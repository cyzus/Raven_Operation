research u s retail e commerce sales eclipsed  billion in  an increase of from  put another way e commerce grew three times faster than retail sales as a whole for the same period but there is a dark cloud on the horizon there are more than million small businesses in the u s the vast majority with fewer than a dozen employees they represent of the entire u s economy and of all new jobs and yet these businesses find it increasingly difficult to cash in on the e commerce revolution it s becoming harder and harder to design and maintain online stores set up merchant accounts control web based inventories and package and ship products as consumers increasingly demand web catalogs and instant online shopping millions of small businesses are missing out without a state of the art web site a wide variety of competitively priced products and services and cutting edge ordering and payment options these small businesses and entrepreneurs are losing billions of dollars in potential profits and because small businesses provide most of the new jobs in america the ripple effect of this failure to offer online shopping could dramatically slow down the economic recovery of the country as a whole plus that s only half of the problem there are millions more people and businesses that would like to sell items on ebay but they either don t own computers or don t want to be bothered with listing and photographing items on ebay nwwv has the ultimate solution fortunately nwwv has developed easy cost effective solutions to these e commerce challenges first nwwv through its web portal

retail price access to merchant account services and direct shipping to buyers for a small monthly fee nwwv allows businesses to have an instant online retail presence second nwwv s other subsidiary auction liquidator has established a relationship with fedex to provide it with nationwide network of drop off centers that will let anyone to sell an item on ebay by just dropping it off at any one of the  fedex or kinkos locations without ever touching a computer auctionliquidator will handle the entire transaction for the seller  and simply send him or her a check once the item sells nwwv recently launched a national radio advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesman bob eubanks longtime tv host of the newlywed game and well known music impresario nwwv is currently in production for their first infomercial which is scheduled for nationwide broadcast beginning in july  legendary tv game show host and celebrity personality bob  eubanksof the newlywed game now national spokesman for nwwv big reasons to consider nwwv before its stock could jump from  a share to  nwwv has innovated the e commerce industry as a one stop online wholesaler and e commerce facilitator nwwv helps thousands of entrepreneurs and small businesses take advantage of the explosion in online shopping and auctioneering according to forrester research e commerce sales will hit  billion this year and  billion by   and nwwv is smack dab in the middle of it nwwv s online auction drop off concept could bring in millions of more auction customers and capture a significant portion of a potential billion market ebay itself estimates that several million people would like to sell items on its service but don t know how to use computers a company like nwwv that has established a drop off presence with fedex  and already has an established online auction wholesale business  could become the dominant player in a brand new growth segment of e commerce nwwv s growth has been nothing short of explosive within three months of its launch in august  nwwv had monthly sales of   for  nwwv just reported annual sales of  million in just their first full calendar year of business and just announced it surpassed over million in monthly sales like ebay and ubid nwwv s growth potential is virtually unlimited a tiny web site with just the right combination of e commerce solutions and products can grow at an exponential rate already nwwv has serviced more than   paid members and is receiving over  new online inquires per day if only of them join the nwwv online shopping club nwwv would triple its rate of growth nwwv s monthly fee of  per month guarantees a steady flow of revenue this guarantees the company a source of revenue for its ongoing marketing

advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesman bob eubanks longtime tv host of the newlywed game and well known music impresario nwwv is also currently in production for their first infomercial which is scheduled for nationwide broadcast beginning in july  by my calculations nwwv would only need increase annual sales ten fold to million for its stock to potentially skyrocket from  a share today to a share it s risky but would turn every  invested into almost   if the current growth continues nwwv could potentially meet sales numbers like that in months or less is it possible for a new company like nwwv to grow that fast you better believe it annual sales of million represent only a miniscule portion  just   of the  billion in total e commerce sales which are growing at the staggering rate of per year dear investor the only sure path to investment wealth is to find breakthrough new companies before anyone else does  and buy them when they re still dirt cheap in this

together in a san jose california living room to discuss launching a new online shopping business they didn t want to sell products themselves like the new company amazon com they simply wanted to help people and businesses sell their products to one another the new web site would make its money from a small upfront fee for using the service and a small percentage of the price of the products sold on the site between and depending upon the price most people of course thought pierre omi dyar and jeff skoll were crazy when their company first went public its stock only sold for a share talk about a small stock but a year later no one thought they were crazy every  invested in ebay grew into   in months and after just nine years in business ebay today has  million registered users a total market cap of billion and annual net revenues in excess of billion i only bring this up to remind you of the astonishing potential of the right e commerce stock quite frankly most of them never get off the ground the dot com bust taught us that a bright idea is not enough that you have to have a solid business plan and substantial growth in revenues to create a winner but when you do find a winner the profits you can make are simply outstanding the company i am going to introduce to you in this issue is just such a breakthrough e commerce stock it has the potential to become another huge winner it is the first company i know of to combine the concepts of wholesale shopping clubs and drop off consignment stores with the exponential power of e commerce and internet auctions like ebay it
