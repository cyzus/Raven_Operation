branded shirt at the heritage classic game excerpts from a recent interview of kewl international coo vish joshi on tradersnations com q how about expansion of kewls current business and product lineswhat are your plans therea as you know the kewl brand has its origins in hockey  as we like to call it  the kewlest sport in the world this is the sport in canada and in some other parts of the world  and actually is still the fastest growing sport in the u s we will continue to capitalize on this  there are lots of fans here in the u s  young and old  and we have a lot of room to grow with this what we plan to do in fact first is to extend the brand with its hockey origins to a broader base of women and children  with an exciting line up of clothing in two new lines  kewl baby and kewl for women we remain very excited about the traditional kewl base  but weve gotten an equally terrific initial reception for the baby line and the womens line i think theyll be big hits we also see great opportunity for careful expansion of the brand to other sports  in particular xtreme sports where we see a window that meshes with kewl hockey soccer and even baseball are other possibilities weve been asked to explore q could you give us some examples of what your clothing related products and what makes it so uniquea kewl is a statement  kewl sport kewl attitude  that hockey lovers would like to make at the ice rink and away from it  and were the only outlet for making it theres no one else in that space and we think we can own it on our clothes ill mention two things  our symbol  the deke  is a hockey move that symbolizes the game and hockey lovers are proud and feel good about displaying it other little things are incorporated in our design  like the fight strap on the back of our shirts no one in a hockey fight wants their shirts pulled over they head  its a touch our fans appreciate and understand q what do you expect in the way of revenues over the next year or so what sort of growtha we have stated that we expect to achieve sales of million  combining kwli and kewl canadian sales in the first year  with roughly half of those in the u s i hope thats conservative and that we can look at a much larger run rate as we enterwere also looking not just at sales  which frankly we could have achieved already  but at profitable sales our main effort to date has been to set up a system that minimizes our cash and borrowing requirements and also permits us to be profitable  at least operationally  from the get go i think this is what investors want to see  and i think i know as this is a big investment for me as well q is your company profitablea were not profitable now  we have no reported revenues as yet weve tried hard to keep a lid on start up expenses though  most of our people are working on small salaries w bonuses for performance q how about other businesses kewl may be involved ina were basically sticking to our knitting no pun intended you may see some nonapparel items  perhaps some equipment with a kewl brand we also already make accessories such as carrying bags a big growth area we believe is our corporate business where we are able to customize products that large groups may use as promotional items  some with special features on it including their name but with our label inside q how about competitors in your businessif so what makes kewl stand out from the resta obviously we have lots of competition for the consumers apparel dollar but we think we have a pretty unique niche with the products  as did adidas when it introduced soccerbased shoes  and nike with basketball in canada sales of the product essentially doubled every year since day one  and even last year with the sars scare sales were up the main limitation on sales to date out of canada has been financing q how about financingwhere do you stand with respect to the money to run your businessesa what young company doesnt need moneysure if we had more we might be a little more aggressive  but it would perhaps make us a little sloppier while we will seek some funding we think that once we get orders coming in the way were set up well be in a largely selffinancing mode were in process now on appropriate accounts receivable financing  how we do this depends on how we determine to handle distributors with that in place we hope to finalize a line of credit weve heard from a number of possible investors  but we have to decide how much to give up to them  and frankly  were in this for the long term and dont want to give up too much prematurely q it would seem to me that your business is affected less by tough economic conditions is this truea im not sure were immune to any significant downturns in consumer spending very few companies are however people  women especially always need clothes that make a statement  and kids keep growing q the stockwhat is the number of shares outstanding and what is in the public floata we have aboutmillion shares outstanding and the float is about two million most of themillion not in the float is in the hands of management and subject to rule restrictions  so no ones going to see it dumped in the market q what is your management doing to increase exposure to your business as well as the stocka as far as the business goes we have solid marketing plans for each line  with implementation depending on how we distribute for hockey based clothing there will be an obvious concentration where there is fan support  and the greatest tool we have in this regard is great support from a big roster of professional players most of our advertising is free  through this support  but we will of course fund pr and advertising efforts on a line by line basis insofar as the stock is concerned we have an internal ir guy and outside support from some good agencies until now weve focused on getting out news  but as we go forward well have a new website and a proactive approach in terms of meetings with the street and media coverage like this q what makes kewl a good investmenta im prejudiced of course but for a speculative investor this is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a unique apparel business with instant appeal to hockey fans  and we think  to fans of other sports im not saying well be another adidas or nike but theyre the models we look at and we think there is a huge growth opportunity in the u s  and also in europe where there are some very serious hockey and extreme sports fans when we start to announce orders i think investors will take notice q where can listeners and investors get more information about kewldo you have a website they can browse arounda well soon have a new website  www kewlsports com  that we think will be pretty exciting and increasingly informative disclaimerinformation within this email contains forward looking statements within the meaning of
