contentlength lines the contact center industry few people today know exactly what a contact center does its predecessor the call center brings to mind large telemarketing operations with people calling your house during dinner time but the fact is that the contact center is much more than that we see numbers everywhere  the back of our credit cards the fast food drivethru window i ll bet even your bottle of water has a phone number to call with questions the fact is that wherever there is an number there is a person answering the call not just a person but millions of people in north america alone across a staggeringcontact centers it used to be the contact center only handled inbound customer service calls and outbound sales calls that was before the proliferation of the internet  now these same customer service reps are waiting for our phone calls our faxes our emails and our web chats we can call from our offices home phones cell phones  even from our computers  americans generate hundreds of millions of transactions each year for contact centers and the industry has grown by leaps and bounds so aggressive is the growth that today we are as likely to get someone in california to answer our call as we are to get someone in india contact centers in north america handle millions of transactions each year for each type of transaction there is a technology that supports it automatic call distributors for inbound calls interactive voice response systems the dreaded press for self service email and web servers in the midst of all of this disparate technology contact centers began to lose track of a very important piece of their puzzleinformation the contact center industry is one of the most data intensive industries think about it  even if you order a pair of shoes the contact center has your name phone number mailing address billing address credit card information etc the contact center also has information on each and every one of their employees and all of their activity every call they received how long they talked how long they placed people on hold how many calls were transferred until now no single piece of technology can track information on all people regarding all activities for one simple reason the activities are all generated and tracked by different technologies human science systems inc hmns company overviewhuman science systems inc pink sheetshmns is a contact center software development firm its flagship product central authorityt serves one main purposeto be a single point of contact for all data generated in the contact center central authorityt can track and disseminate all data generated in the contact center regardless of the technology where the data originated central authorityt is a contact center resource management ccrmt product ccrm is the act of managing data regarding all human physical and technical resources within the contact center contact center resources can all be categorized under four distinct umbrellasemployees technology capacity and clients it may be hard to believe but the reality is that all functions within the contact center fall under one of those four categories and our company has come up with a method and a technology that allows departments to easily exchange and leverage valuable data on a realtime basis why hmns should be on your radardatamonitor states that the us contact center market reached a volume ofcontact centers inand that by the end ofthat number will exceedcontact centers contact center reporting and data tracking has always been burdensome more so with the incorporation of the various technologies required to successfully compete in the industry today s contact center requires a responsiveness that can only be achieved with timely and accurate insight into business conditions but this is not easily accomplished in the absence of methods and technology to easily collect data from numerous disparate sources contact centers are looking to replace manual or semiautomated methods of data collection and dissemination because they are not only burdensome but highly inaccurate and complex hmns principals have an established track record as industry experts going back overyears and have high level contacts in all of the top tier contact centers top tier contact centers generate over million per year within the north american market hmns has patentable methods and technologies and recently retained a well known technology patent attorney to process its applications for the protection of its intellectual property a recent report by empire research associates stated that the company could achieve rapid market share penetration in the contact center industry market segment and that a market share level in five years would be plausible with a mere market share asales margin fully taxed would implymillion of net income inin that event the report noted that on the presentmillion shares earnings would exceedper share the report concluded that the target market is large and enticing to hmns and we believe the company s product has a good chance of hitting it the company is negotiating distributorships through software distributors that currently generate billions of dollars in revenue from the center industry hmns will generate revenue not only from software sales but from application service provider asp services from customers that subscribe to the technology and access it by the internet from installation billable atof the total software sale and recurring maintenance recurring annual revenue billable atof the value of the softwaredatamonitor recently estimated the global market for call center component technologies at billion and predicts an increase to billion bygrowing at a compounded

to spend billion on contact center technology management and other commentslou mandic hmns ceo presidentthis technology was born out of years worth of research we are well engrained in this industry and are keenly aware of its needs we are without a doubt delivering the most mission critical software in the industry today we anticipate rapid growth which is not uncommon in our industry by its fourth year of operation blue pumpkin  a company that provides only a portion of what central authority offers  had already captured a market share a far lesser market share will have our company earning better thanmillion annually company philosophyif you can measure it you can manage it things to consideraccording to empire research the company has a competitively superior product a large enough market to support sustained rapid growth and a proprietary market position that can provide handsome profit returns hmns is in the process of establishing distributorships with companies that annually sell billions of dollars worth of software to contact centers hmns has buyout appeal and has already been approached by far larger players that may later be interested in acquiring the company and or its intellectual property how the technology works central authorityt is a software product that fills the role of a central repository of data through meta data tables the software is able to read all other technologies and act as a central point of contact for the enterprise the software also collects data inherently this is data entered directly into central authorityt not collected from other systems on employees recruiting sources and performance enabling the organization to better manage its human resource processes and reducing its turnover which can be as high as in the contact center industry conclusionthe problem with interdepartmental communications is not exclusive to the contact center industry it is a problem for corporate america as a whole companies like human science systems are delivering the next mission critical piece of software  one that can normalize all data across all technologies and act as a single central point of contact for the enterprise
