contentlength dear friend my name is mr dan michaels chief credit officer cco standard chartered bank sorry to have to bump on you like this please dont be offended when you get back to me i would explain how i came about your coordinates on decembera foreigner mr peter smith made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at in my branch upon maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply after a month i sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers that mr smith died from an automobile accident on further investigation i found out that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless i therefore made checks and found out that mr smith did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his deposit paperwork here from past experiences i know that no one will ever come forward to claim the deceased funds according to my country laws at the expiration of five years the funds will be unclaimed and revert to the ownership of the state if nobody applies to claim the fund in order to avert this development i in conjunction with a colleague the chief operating officer in the bank now seek your permission to allow an attorney do a backdated will in your name so that the funds would be released to you as the new owner on behalf of me and my colleague we are writing you because as public servants we cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than five hundred thousand in my country s currency consequently i will present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of an attorney this is simple i will like you to provide immediately yourfull names full contact address phone fax numbers so that an attorney will prepare the necessary papers which will put you in place as the new owner it will then be released to you for us to split the attorney will do all the paperwork and this will guarantee everything upon your response i shall then provide you with more details and further explanation that will help you understand note also that we shall require your assistance to invest our share in your country buying of properties like houses hotels etc thanks and regards dan michaels good day
