 oil for america has been successful in locating the reefs out of times breaking news press release delek to acquire oil producing properties wednesday june   am et click here for full release delek s main project involves exploring for the mississippian aged lodgepole carbonate build ups in the williston basin of montana and north dakota as well as the hardeman basin in west texas a new exploration technique is being applied to this play which has proven succesfull the lodgepole limestone was deposited in a very shallow ancestral williston basin the carbonate formation was developed as thousands of small circular limestone build ups or reefs the average distribution of the build ups is about reefs per square mile section the lodgepole reefs were deposited within a fairway a thousand miles long and thirty miles wide on the shelf of the williston basin the reservoirs in the williston basin may produce as much as  barrels per day bopd at depths of  to  feet the most prolific reefs have each produced as much as   barrels of light sweet oil the lodgepole reefs are visible in surface outcrop in the far western part of the williston basin this allows the sense of scale and geometry of the reefs can be observed first hand delek resource s technology partner in this play is a company named oil for america ofa ofa has applied a proprietary photo analytical program known as all remote sensing analysis this analysis detects the location of waulsortian reef cores this program produces well defined images that correlate with the oil producing wells oil for america s first partner conoco who was the major player in the lodgepole reef play stated that the lodgepole reefs are the most economic production it has anywhere in the world the average well in the united states produces a few barrels per day each one of these lodgepole wells is so prolific that it amounts to a thousand of those wells because each well may produce  bod and   bo cumulatively from a single well bore well in excess    of revenue may be generated from a well in a relatively brief period of production the potential for significant new discoveries in the williston basin began in february  from a wildcat well near dickinson north dakota conoco tested a heretofore non productive interval in the lodgepole limestone the carbonate zone had good porosity and gas shows so after failing to find pay in their deeper objectives a production test was reluctantly taken at     feet the discovery well dickinson lodgepole unit  initially produced at a rate of  bopd the well has produced nearly million barrels of  api gravity sweet crude oil and  bcf of natural gas to date this discovery ignited a frantic race between  and  where major and independent oil companies attempted to develop and expand the lodgepole find using conventional  d and d seismic programs the best wells flowed up to an allowable rate of  bopd the conoco dickinson lodgepole  is the single most productive well having produced   barrels of oil and nearly bcf of gas since september  this well still produces thousands of barrels a month after more than nine years of production during this time the lodgepole reef play became the largest onshore play in america this success however was not without failure the ability to seismically delineate discrete reefs has been very difficult and misleading the geophysical characteristics of the lodgepole limestone are nearly identical with the overlying carbonate beds this creates very poor acoustic contrast between the formations so seismic differentiation between the formations is difficult as a result by  the search for additional lodgepole reefs had stalled the play was recently revitalized when continental resources made another accidental discovery in december  in valley county montana  miles northwest of dickinson north dakota in this area the lodgepole reefs are shallower at  feet this reef initially produced at  barrels per day but has now begun producing water it appears that the well was drilled on the flank of a reef close to water the discovery dramatically increases the exploratory opportunities for future discoveries in the lodgepole oil for america has been successful in locating the reefs out of times and has now begun using another technology to differentiate reefs that show signs of hydrocarbons as to minimize the possibility of drilling a reef that would be a dry hole and is confident that the three technologies applied overall makes the chances of drilling a successful producing reef excellent using these technologies delek will drill those targets in the williston basin delek intends to raise money and acquire producing properties in the near term the properties would complement the exploration as it will be in the same areas as the exploration the company is pursuing symbol dlkr ob keep an eye out for more upcoming breakings news disclaimer safe harbor statement information
