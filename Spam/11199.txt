industries operates in the modular building construction industry and strategically targets the california education sector gdvi is strategically located in central california on acres with a   square foot state of the art manufacturing facility throughout  the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions development of a state of the art manufacturing facility and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth through the combination of its new facility the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california s bond approvals gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast gdvi should benefit greatly from the  billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month march this presents in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout  including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in  the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into million per annum businesses in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue projections renewed its piggyback contract received state approvals on engineered product designs started a new credit facility and opened its new   square foot manufacturing facility the

inc an entity which holds equipment and inventory for the registrant mbs construction inc a modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and global modular inc a sales marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures its principal customer base is currently educational public and private schools universities etc child care and municipality sectors its product lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs including both single story and two  story floor plans global modular s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre approved building plans commonly referred to as p c s or pre checked plans that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects dsa global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years depending on the term of the piggyback contract the strategic focus on california schools since  california legislation has required that at least of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures there are five compelling reasons for this trend modular classrooms are faster to construct as quickly as weeks they cost significantly less as low as  vs   they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth the state department of education estimates that california will need more than  classrooms each year for the next four years which equates to more than  classrooms due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector public and private schools are expected to turn to portable modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years the california schools budget crisis on november  a  billion school facilities improvements bond proposal proposition was passed by california voters this bond measure passage does not include an approximate  billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state a second bond measure worth  billion will go before the voters on the march  ballot which is expected to pass these bond measures are about three times higher than the record  billion bond california voters approved in  the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other institutions of higher learning throughout california gdvi business infrastructure among global modular s asset base is its integrated state of the  art automated manufacturing process which includes equipment raw material
