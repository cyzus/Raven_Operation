stocks are too expensive and he poured a chunk of his money into china that s especially important now since warren buffett made such big news with his huge china investment everyone knows what happens when mr buffett gets into a market it usually explodes mr buffett s strong move also means that every charlatan stock advisor in the u s will now be trying to sell you some sort of hot chinese investment but they don t have what we have they don t have a network of analysts already on the ground in china doing the hard work for you the fortunes made on the american stock markets in the late s will look paltry when compared to the profit explosion that s set to blast out of china in the coming years as you re about to see there s not a single reason  not one  for you to miss what should be the greatest wealth creation opportunity of your lifetime  you know what happens when warren buffett gets onto a good thing everybody gets rich warren buffett has gotten into china here s what the respected bloomberg news said about that these excerpts come from a may bloomberg news wire storywarren buffett s search for cheap stocks has brought his to a surprising placechina a month after telling berkshire hathaway shareholders that shares of u s companies were too expensive buffett s company upped its stake in petrochina it now owns of the company  it s clear that china is the place for you to be now and in the coming years the profits will be stunning but only if you re aligned with an expert team that puts you into the best chinese companies first one reason for that sweet number is because sunwin s product is of such high quality in fact its customers during the past year as divided equally between major suppliers in japan and china and suwn has a nice mix of both local and export customers last year they had sales to the local chinese domestic exports to japanand exports to other foreign countries when suwn s natural sweetener penetrates the us markets it will take some market share of synthetic sweetener even natural sweetener takes a tiny fraction of market share of synthetic sweetener in the us it could means tens of millions of dollars to suwn suwn will add a new manufacturing line for its natural sweetener in that should make tons of highly purified natural sweetener it will add million tomillion in sales and to million in net income this is why betting on suwn is a sure thing to win huge they re testimony to a management team that has excellent control over suwn s cost of goods sold and operating expenses this is a wellrun company that we should assume will continue this path and grow by acquiring more topquality beet sugar producers as well  we believe the suwn story will get a lot of attention in the investment community in the coming months the average company on this list in this industry has a market cap valued atx revenues on this ground alone we should expect suwn market cap to bemillion orper share the average of pe ratio in the industry ison this ground alone it will give suwn stock valued at per share the average ratio of price earning growth in the industry on the list is on this ground alone we should expect suwn to be per share an average valuation will value suwn at per share we believe that it is just a matter of time before suwn an undervalued stock with tremendous upside potential will be recognized
