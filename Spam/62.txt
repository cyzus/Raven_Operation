 CO-OPERATION MOST NEEDED Dear Beloved My name is Obi Philips I am for the most part a legal consultant of  an European owned private bank with over 10 Billion under Management I am writing regarding the contents of a certain numbered account  whose holder passed away under tragic circumstances Since the demise of the account holder My firm has been contacted regarding establishing the legitimacy or otherwise of any claim that  may arise in furtherance of the administration of the late account  holders estate Unfortunately the account holder died intestate and efforts to locate  a legitimate successor have proved abortive so far The statutory  period for establishing a claim has all but lapsed At the expiration of  this period we will have to submit a report to the bank and the estate of the demised account holder will statutorily revert to the State on disclosure I do not want to bore you with legal jargon but I need to mention  that the country in question respects the laws of intestate succession  which would mean that without a valid will the estate will revert to a surviving relative of the deceased anywhere in the world as long as  lineage can be established We my colleagues and I will be willing to compensate you  handsomely for you to present yourself as the next of kin of the demised  account holder We would make the necessary representation and documentation available for you to establish this claim without incident but we all  have to be prepared to go the legal distance Specifically we would be willing to compensate you with 20 of a perceived inheritance exceeding 26million I would not be able to  disclose any further information regarding this transaction till you indicate serious intent I can be contacted via this medium  obiphilips web-mail com ar or my private fax 234-1-7591074 and I  will furnish you preliminary details to assuage your misgivings if any presently I will give you my contact Telephone numbers in Nigeria  if further discussions are necessary following initial contact I  respectfully dismiss myself sine die Thank you for your patience
