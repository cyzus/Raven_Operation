population greater than new york city about million people with inhome internet and email access for the first time ever not just an ordinary population either but one that is populated with wealth education and the desire to travel that s what insystcom isyj executives figured a few years back when they pioneered an exclusive technology to deliver internet and email access on cruise ships using the ship’s existing wiring that’s not all they also pioneered the installation of incabin amenities as videoondemand vod satellite tv video gaming interactive services travel and entertainment booking plus more now after three very successful pilot installations detailed later in this alert and a fourth just completed insystcom is now shipping its sealynx™ system setting a course for full scale

silverseas cruise line and only days ago announced their second deployment in the oceania cruise line press releasebusinesswire that’s vessels already and more news is likely to be released in the coming weeks all this sets the stage for a move onto otcbb which is precisely where company chairman and ceo will riner sr is ready to take isyj from there the breakout could unfold at a skyrocketing pace a share price by july invest in isyj now you’ll be in at arounda share just preceding the time when next year’s investors could be clamoring for shares at or more t he independent investment

installation schedule isyj profits could be com ing on fast according to projections provided by ceo wil riner insystcom could reach first profitability as early asnd quartercompanies on the pink sheets fantasize about the day when they may see revenues let alone those that turn a profit yet insystcom is projecting profits just a few months from now what’s more the current installations are working as planned and revenues are beginning to flow that make profits in q a very real probability thus this is one of those pivotal moments in a company’s life that marks a turning point for investors do you invest now or do you wait and miss the explosive price surge coming out of pink sheet valuationsif you’re an aggressive investor the answer should be clear at today’s share price this

risk what’s more by buying now you’ll be setting the stage for a major breakout in the future and a fat profit to pad your position not a pipe dream not an r d promise it’s real onboard andhappening now since the insystcom is already operational on a number of ships serving tens of thousands of passengers you don’t have to wait for the sales department to prove that there’s a market either new orders should be coming in very quickly especially as cruise lines see the capabilities of their competitors grow rather than looking for customers insystcom could be faced with the enviable problem of having them line up at the door competitionnot any time soon this isa fantasy island of profit opportunity you’ll love this part of the showright now there’s no competition to the insystcom technology it’s the only show in town if a cruise line wants internet connections to the cabins it has two choices dry dock and retrofit or choose insystcom to interface with their existing systems the growing marketand only one source for a sensible solution according to more cruise industry statistics aboutmillion passengers of cruise ship passengers boarded north american cruise ships you know what that means a whole city full of americans with no personal access to the internet even for email these are people who write big checks for first class service it’s reasonable to think that the vast majority of them live by email at home and at work and since most cruises last more than a week internet access could be a makeorbreak point about booking a cruise what’s more the problem is getting worse since the yearthe cruise industr y has grown from million passengers to million bythe figures are expected to soar past million passengers and you’re going to deny these people access to the internetsince most cruise ships were built years ago with wiring that did not anticipate a modern internet the cruise operators have had nothing to offer except onboard public internet lounges that just doesn’t cut it inthe insystcom solution puts the internet into every cabin on board live sports shows and movies too from marketing perspective this could be the right product at the right time for a growing industry once a cruise company makes the commitment to upgrade to incabin internet email and interactive services insystcom can have a fully operational system up and running in a matter of weeks with no downtime and no disruption to normal cruise activities insystcom’s technology breakthrough came when it developed an interface that linked the existing phone wiring with the ship’s cband or kband com links these com links provide the uplink and downlink needed to enable internet and satellite tv access while the insystcom sealynx system manages the bandwidth possible on the roomtoroom wiring network as reported by insystcom management nobody else has this technology nor anything like it what’s more insystcom is not just targeting the cruise ship industry the resorts at cruise ship destinations face the same dilemmas highend resorts on remote is lands face similar challenges providing guests with access to online entertainment movies and sports programming that their american guests have come to expect using insystcom technology resorts could soon offer a complete menu of inroom entertainment including internet access and email that market adds millions more travelers to insystcom’s potential revenue equation invest now in isyj and you could sit back and relax on a profitmaking cruise of a lifetime and you can expect your investment will be well managed because even though insystcom is a relatively new companyinsystcom is commanded by a seasoned crew of technology and cruise industry veterans with veterans like this at the helm you can be certain
