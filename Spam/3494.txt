Ideal Financial Solutions, Inc. Signs Direct Marketing Agreement with Future Comm. Technologies, LLC


Future Comm. Technologies is a direct marketing company that has an experienced team of marketers that has been test marketing Ideal's products for the past 30 days. Future Comm. is the first direct marketing company to sign an exclusive marketing agreement with Ideal, wherein it will sell only Ideal's products and services. Future Comm. is a small regional direct marketing firm with the capacity to expand its current Salt Lake City, UT facility to over a 120 marketers.


"This is an historic time for both of our companies and we are pleased to be the first company to sign a direct marketing agreement with Ideal. Ideal's services are unique and their application by any customer will have a powerful and profound effect on his or her financial stability and future. We believe that Ideal's products, services and systems are some of the most revolutionary in the financial services space to come along in the last decade," said Darren Freeman, Future Comm. Technologies' CEO. "When you can sell a product that actually helps people and changes lives for the better, it is very rewarding. What is even more amazing is that during our test-marketing phase our marketers were averaging over $1,000 dollars per day in sales, which is unheard of for a new product. Now that we have perfected the marketing and sales process we have seen these numbers double and triple and expect this trend to continue over the next several months," said Freeman.


The management team has worked with successful public companies such as Novell, Mellon Financial Corporation, eRoomSystem Technologies and Franklin Covey. Imagine what they could do for the average American? 

Their goal is simple: to help secure the financial futures of 
Americans, one family at a time.
