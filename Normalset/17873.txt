 hi vince yannis of the weather desk is planning to develop relationship with prof rene carmona in doing weather analysis to start this off they are planning to pay prof carmona to give a training class as outlined below and they want to know if research is willing to send people and bear part of the costs we can talk more at pm but while there is no doubt that getting people from outside to present new ideas is always important and interesting i think research group members can easily give most of these talks apparently people are interested in these topics and are willing to pay to listen my thought is that if the intent is to develop relationships that is fine but the research group should also be given the opportunity to provide more training and get more visibility i have already communicated this to joe and to yannis vasantforwarded by vasant shanbhogue hou ect onamfromyannis tzamouranis enron enronxgate onam tovasant shanbhogue hou ect ect ccsubjecthere is a tentative course description day extreme value distriutions and copulasheavy tail distributionsexploratory data analysis and detection extreme value distributions and generalized pareto distributions estimation and simulation practical examplesnotions of dependence and copulas estimation and simulation experiments with the program evanece day principal component analysis and modern regressionprincipal component analysis and applications to the yield curve and the detection of contagion in financial marketsnonlinear regression and the construction of yield curvesnonparametric regression kernel and projection pursuit methods and alternatives to the blackscholes formula to option pricing day time series analysis examples of temperature time series will be used to introduce and illustrate the following concepts and techniques removing trends and seasonal components and stationarityfitting the classical autoregressive and moving average modelsdiscretization of stochastic differential equationsmultivariate time series day nonlinear systems and filteringarch garch and stochastic volatility modelslinear state space models and the classical kalman filternonlinear systems and particle filteringapplications
