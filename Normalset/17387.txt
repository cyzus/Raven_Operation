forwarded by bryan seyfried lon ect on martin mcdermotttojohn sherriff lon ect ect bryan seyfried lon ect ect ccsubjectasset swaps vs cds s john i haven t had much time to put something together on this issue fundamentally both instruments represent the same credit risk i e same credit events and contingent payments both represent senior unsecured credit risk the differences in pricing therefore arise purely from supply and demand one would expect generally that the asset swap would be lower than the cds because of liquiditythere are only so many bonds out there and so demand for asset swaps is limited i am attaching a one page note by jp morgan where they claim that one of the principal reasons for the cds to be more expensive is people hedging convertible bonds by combininga call option on the equity anda cds if the call is cheap they will be willing to pay more for the cds driving the price up i ll try to synthesize something more complete next week cheers martin
