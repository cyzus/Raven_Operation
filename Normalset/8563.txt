 louise since our conversation today i have discovered that by terminating the reuters contract we will lose the entire headline news category as well as the stock quotes sports news and weather news reuters costs over per month this pushes the cost of content for newco to over for relatively little benefit therefore contrary to what we agreed earlier i would like to drop all of the content on the right side of the quotes screen we will adjust screen size or insert graphics accordingly to get things looking right until our phaseexpansion please advise if you agree dave
