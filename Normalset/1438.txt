 this is the memo I was referring to Forwarded by Brent A Price HOU ECT on Richard SageToBrent A Price HOU ECT ECT ccSubjectFor DiscussionImplementing Definition of Trading Office i e very draft What are your thoughts Forwarded by Richard Sage LON ECT on Richard SageToMike Jordan LON ECT ECT Andrew Cornfield LON ECT ECT Naomi Connell LON ECT ECT Phil Redman LON ECT ECT Tim PoullainPatterson LON ECT ECT ccSubjectFor DiscussionImplementing Definition of Trading Office I was going to write that the buying and selling of physical commodity locally was OK but that hedging had to be done with Regional Hub The problem with this model is that it describes Helsinki before the bust Another possiblity is the agency model where the local trader acts under the direction of the hub trader This is where Helsinki currently is although we also have an independent manager on site However I am not so happy with this and Rick Causey certainly does not like it Perhaps we should recommend independent Risk Managers in every office but all correspondence and settlement with regional hub
