 louise i do not think it is possible to begin selling the ats warrants at this time per the ats warrant certificate the ats common shares issuable on exercise of the warrants may not be sold transferred or otherwise traded until march the warrants are also nontransferable except to an affiliate in addition the ats warrants are valued daily using a blackscholes model the spreadsheet with the result of the evaluation is attached the current value of the warrants is usd using the evaluation model however the current ats stock price on the canadian venture exchange isc with an warrant exercise price ofc for the firstshare tranche the secondshare tranche has an exercise price ofc thus the current value is considerably less than the blackscholes evaluation model is calculating if you have any questions please give me a call at extensionkevin miller
