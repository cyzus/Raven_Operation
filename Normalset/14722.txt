 stinson i think the gamma will flow into v r vince stinson gibnerpm toalex huang corp enron enron ccvince j kaminski hou ect ect vasant shanbhogue hou ect ect subjectcompound model for reedy creek alex paulo and i have continued to look at the model and have come up with a couple of additional changesthe cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike payment also paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future valuesi would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree approach to a onedimensional integration perhaps using a quadrature method this may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuitiesedith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for anything if it is we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma thanks stinson
