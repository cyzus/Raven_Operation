html after a warm october the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the midwest and northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than per million british thermal units mmbtu over the past week this rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil assuring that dualfuel loads remain off of gas supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dualfuel end users to burn gas if this cold snap extends through the remainder of november a heavy earlywinter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter though storage inventories have reached near the billion cubic feet bcf level they remain at a record low heading into the heating season and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring this supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price near in the gulf coast and into a range potentially testing the next difficult level of demand resistance this resistance could come from switching to distillate oil but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above per mmbtu and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher rather a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more pricesensitive end users may be required none of these measures comes easily or cheaply however and they can be overwhelmed by weatherdriven swings in demand as a result as cold weather settles in cera expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts under normal weather conditions cera expects henry hub prices to average during december see tablewhich by itself would represent an all time high for december but even this estimate could prove low if the current cold snap extends through early december prices could easily climb into the per mmbtu range gas storagethe record low maximum cera estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of bcf as of the end of october a record low for that month bybcf see tableeven this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the gulf of mexico and consistent warmth through most of october the withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week however and in a strong way the cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month increasing the withdrawal rate this november to bcf per day on average well above the bcf per day average rate of the past two years by the end of this month the us inventory deficit is likely to have widened again tobcf cera estimates that normal december weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately bcf per day which is above last year s rate of bcf per day this year however this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through december and beyond as it would keep inventories on a path to reachbcf by the end of march just below thealltime endofmarch low ofbcf so long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even trillion cubic feet tcf by next fall although the supply build will begin to help by late winter it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occurunless demand continues to be priced out of the market demandkeeping warm after last year s warm winter cera expects a strong rebound in heating demand and this week s weather and forecast reinforce that expectation weather last winter november through march was the warmest of the decade and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season under normal weather conditions average heating demand through the winter would be bcf per day higher than last year s monthly average heating demand through the winter would be bcf per day peaking at bcf per day in january december heating demand would increase by bcf per day relative to last december weatherpercent colder than normal could further increase december demand by bcf per day relative to normal weather; likewise apercent warmerthannormal scenario could decrease demand by bcf per day relative to normal weather fuel switching with natural gas markets this tight there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market this winter we expect all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so a loss ofmillion cubic feet mmcf per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter industrial consumers to switch the equivalent ofmmcf per day off of gas gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices as much as resid will act as a floor for gas for december cera expects an overall demand increase of bcf per day relative to last december and a bcf per day increase in demand relative to november with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching supplythe rebound the pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense but us supply is beginning to rebound the recent steep decline in us lower capacity is expected to reverse in lategiven the soaring gasrelated rig count the success in reversing the decline in the gulf of mexico is related to the combination ofthe rampup of the hickory and tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf adding to the recent startup of the muni field; these fields could add over bcf per day later in the response of the shallow water to the strong lateturnaround in drilling activity other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater gulf of mexico with bcf per day inandand onshore led by the bossier sand play in freestone county texas the barnett shale play in wise county texas and the powder river basin coal seam play further increases in drilling are likely to slow new deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews regional marketswild winter in the west extremely cold weather in the west has brought rockies prices close to parity with henry hub prices and triggered early season spikes at sumas in the north and topock in the south pipeline maintenance on el paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to topock differentials of over per mmbtu tight pricing relationships to the henry hub in the san juan and rocky mountains should hold through february with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline winter has arrived in earnest across north america but the startup of firm transportation service on alliance is delayed once again this time until decembernonetheless flows on the pipeline are under way; cera estimates that flows during october averagedmmcf per day during november that total should climb tommcf per day despite the later published start date with or without alliance flows a weatherdriven rebound in midwestern demand relative to november and december last year should keep prices in chicago at a significant premium to henry hub prices in the northeast differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter despite greater flows into the region from atlantic canada this year see tablecera s outlook by region followsrockies very cold weather within the region has brought rocky mountain prices near parity with henry hub prices a break in the cold or a cold snap in the east will likely widen the differentials but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about per mmbtu below the henry hub price cera expects a december average differential of per mmbtu; however this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather a warm week in the rockies could still push differentials toward per mmbtu san juan san juan prices will continue to hold close to rockies prices through the winter with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions heating loads in the rockies will determine the san juan to henry hub differential with extended cold weather in the rockies pulling both prices close to the henry hub price cera expects the december differential in the san juan basin to average per mmbtu permian and midcontinent unlike prices within the rest of the west differentials between the henry hub and the midcontinent and permian basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west depending on regional weather cera expects a permian to henry hub differential of per mmbtu and a midcontinent differential of per mmbtu for december chicago alliance flows into the chicago market are now running close tommcf per day however the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed chicago differentials up to near per mmbtu relative to the henry hub despite delays in the completion of the vector pipeline cera expects the strong pricing at chicago to continue and december differentials should average per mmbtu northeast markets assuming normal weather we expect to see december basis for new york relative to henry hub at per mmbtu new england will likely see prices higher depending on the pipeline much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs for example with apercent retention rate from the gulf coast into new england last december would have seen retention costs of approximately; at that same retention equates to despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the northeast from the atlantic canadian fields there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets and an additional mmbtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity because of this tightness should this month s weather be colder than normal we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in januarythese spikes could even exceed the highs seen in january depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized canadian marketswinter begins the colderthannormal weather has increased demand in western canada but is only now being felt in the east storage peaked in the west in early october at approximatelybcf below last year s level andbcf below the fiveyear average even with modest withdrawals since that time storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs easter canadian storage has continued to grow pushing levels to overbcfbcf above last year and well above the fiveyear average with the eastward movement of the colder weather withdrawals are likely to begin this higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on transcanada the good news resulting from the cold is a more normal freezeup which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season gas well completions are expected to reach forand will likely be even higher next year further delays for alliancethe commercial inservice date for alliance has been delayed until decemberthe result of a combination of problems with clearing the line delays in the completion of the aux sable liquids extraction plant the delay of vector and a lack of supply the pipeline has been flowing gas however with volumes building up since september it is estimated that flows for november will averagemmcf per day transcanada has taken the full brunt of the alliance flows so far with northern border and pgt remaining strong december should see alliance flows build to betweenand mmcf per day with modest reductions in flows on northern border and pgt storage withdrawals will likely keep transcanada reductions close tommcf per day year overyear until vector begins service to eastern canada high pricesstrong pull west the high demand in the pacific
