p m et by darryl richards foxsports com the first national champion of the millennium will not be the product of a spaceage spread offense inspired by a mad scientist who calls himself an offensive coordinator the best college football team in america this season will run the most basic of offenses call the option many thingsplain boring ancient uninspired but when nebraska runs it its cruel and usual punishment for opposing defenses teams may be able to slow it down but over the course of four quarters they will pay a price slammed repeatedly by an offensive line that averagespounds remember the limp noodles crawling out of sun devil stadium in januarythat was tennessees defense after the cornhuskers droveyards in the fourth quarter of the fiesta bowl the beauty of the system is that it is the perfect offense for the current rage of defenses using quick blitzing attacks sure you can send everybody after the ball but the option demands you stop and think and play an assignment how do you properly scout a team that runs an offense you see only once a yearthe answer is you dont arguably the cornhuskers foxsports com s noteam in its preseason topwere playing the best football in the country by the end of theseason in their last five games the cornhuskers beat texas a m kansas state colorado texas and tennessee by a cumulative score ofthe scary thing about nebraska is thatoffensive starters return for a team that finishedlast season the cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again it starts in the offseason and continues through january the running game took a while to materialize last season because of injuries but iback dan alexander and quarterback eric crouch have the ability to rush for yards this season even if the oftinjured alexander cant hold up to the pounding the cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a fitting name for this smashmouth football teamthunder collins nebraska will not only push other teams around the cornhuskers will push themselves the school is touting guard russ hochstein and center dominic raiola for the outland trophy presented to the nation s outstanding interior lineman the beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense this group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come august and september said nebraska coach frank solich who has his best team since taking over for tom osborne three years ago we have a rich history and a team coming off a good season that is not questioning things we have high expectations some of it comes from how we finished last season a lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition the option and the huskers are inextricably bound it is their offense and they have been running it so long it is practically an openbook test for defensive coordinators yet only eight teams have passed the test over the last seven years nebraska has wongames and three national titles in that span we try to keep up with whats current and we use the spring to experiment solich said but our players and coaches like to line up and beat you our players that are here love it it is an aggressive style of play and thats how they want to play it its what our players want to do on offense the cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged crouch can put his name up there with the turner gill tommie frazier and scott frost for the title of best nebraska quarterback ever but all bets are off for this team if crouch is hurt because the cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback the schedule has its pitfalls too notre dame looking for a win that can restore luster and a reason to keep coach bob davie gets nebraska at home on septa resurgent oklahoma team and top rival kansas state get nebraska at their places kansas state won the last time the teams met in manhattan the cornhuskers will probably play texas or oklahoma in the bigchampionship game which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish the cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses ralph and mike brown but nebraska carlos polk back as the heart of the defense polk is heralded by nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history but come januarynebraska will play florida state for the national titleand the seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack senior writer darryl richards covers
