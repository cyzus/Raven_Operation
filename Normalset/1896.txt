 Funny This did not get mentioned in our meeting with DaveForwarded by Jeffrey C Gossett HOU ECT onPMFromZhiyong Wei ENRON enronXgate onPM ToJeffrey C Gossett HOU ECT ECT ccRuss Severson HOU ECT ECT SubjectSingle deal entry Jeff I just found out that the development of phase single deal entry project didn t start as scheduled due to resource constraints Therefore the development won t be done until mid of April Sorry for the delay I will make sure to deliver it to you for testing by the middle of April After consulting Russ and SitaraTDS team the phase single deal entry will allow users to enter simple types of physical deals at deal creation time It does not provide any editing functionality In other words once the deals are saved to the system any changes need to be done through both TAGG and Sitara Please see below for a short list of complex deals that are not going to be captured in phase Russ helped me put the list together Deal Types not Captured in the PhaseSingleDealCaptureDeals with multiple locations each of which has different cost of gas because TAGG does not capture location information For example a location deal will result inSitara deal withCPR tickets andTAGG legs Each Tagg leg capturing the risk between contract price and mid for that locationStructured deals which have different volume for different months and whose different risk components will be managed by different desksTiered pricing structured deals that require one Sitara ticket and more than one TAGG ticket For example deal volume in broken down to at fixed price at NYMEXand at the indexPhysical options because TDS deal capture does not handle physical optionsTrigger deals that allow setting prices before index settles Basic trigger deal can be captured Entry problem relates if price trigger is managed in a different book or if different volume is triggered or untriggered than the original deal volumePhysical index deals with the index that is different from the mid for the location Such deals need to be broken down into an index a long basis and a short basis in TAGGPercentage index deals that require two legs in TAGG One leg is index flat and the other is fixed price deal with zero fixed price and zero basis and reduced quantity For example aindex deal with a quantity ofcan be broken down into one leg of index flat and the other leg of zero fixedprice and zero basis and a quantity ofFloating basis deals Deals can be entered with a price and physical premium component where the basis will default to the actual basis settle These deals are sometimes entered as trigger deals with a floating basis The deal looks like a straight index deal however the price can be triggered and the basis will default to actual I would appreciate your comments Zhiyong
