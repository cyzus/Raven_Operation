uncertain futureafter six years profit from company s power operations remains years away by elizabeth williamsonthe wall street journal europecopyright cdow jones company inc nowa sarzyna polandfrom a small power plant humming among the birches near the ukrainian border enron corp has staked its claim on the polish energy market yet after six years the company is still seeking a mother lode the houstonbased energy producer and trader entered poland innabbed one of the first powertrading licenses to go to a foreign company and began work on elektrocieplownie nowa sarzyna poland s first new foreignoperated heatandpower plant other companies followed including electricite de france rwe ag of germany vattenfall ab of sweden and tractebel sa of belgium the prize could be a rich one all of these companies hope to profit as poland sells its state energy assets and frees prices before joining the european union a wholesale power bourse is due to open in warsaw in july and the country s transmission links to markets east and west could make poland the powertrading hub of central europe but after six years in poland enron has yet to earn a profit net income from nowa sarzyna which is to begin commercial production later this month is at least five years away powertrading operations might generate profits next year if the new bourse gets moving but that is one big question mark says jarek astramowicz enron poland s president indeed despite its promise poland s energy sector remains a sizzling tangle of aging plants archaic market agreements and complex shifting regulations enron withbillion billion euros in annual revenue is an innovator and an investment bellwether for its peers but in a power market as negatively charged as poland s the company also is an example of how shaky market conditions can keep even the savviest competitors offline these are very large operations and to some extent they can bear some risks says pawel kaminski energysector operations officer at the world bank in warsaw but eventually they have to generate some return enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the u s it entered europe insetting up in london as the u k s energy sector liberalized it entered the nordic market inand today is the nord pool s largestvolume trader enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits for a power plant and a furthermonths for construction just four years after entering the u k enron finished itsmegawatt teesside plant teesside s capacity and cost at gbpmillion billion euros are many times larger than nowa sarzyna s yet teesside was completed in only twothirds the time the company declines to compare development times in various countries i wouldn t necessarily put poland into the same category as russia says philip davies regulatory and governmentaffairs manager at enron europe in london but obviously given poland s planned economy past it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process and get to the starting point at nowa sarzyna it took enron nearly twice the usual time to reach the starting point even though mr astramowicz already knew the site and the polish power industry s rules the nowa sarzyna plant was mr astramowicz s brainchild and he burned out the engine in his first bmw as he traveled between warsaw and the town to craft the deal a freelance energysector entrepreneur before joining enron mr astramowicz sold his interest in nowa sarzyna to enron inenron has spentmillion to build nowa sarzyna a megawatt gasfired combined heatandpower plant quiet clean and efficient the plant stands in stark contrast to most of poland s belching coalfired behemoths when it starts up this month it will sell its electricity to the polish power grid the country s highvoltage network under a year powerpurchase agreement or ppa that enron won insteam output goes to organika the chemical company next door and helps heat the town of nowa sarzyna the nowa sarzyna plant is more thanfinanced by commercialbank loans for which the only collateral is the plant s concluded contracts they were betting on their good name says michael davies a partner with allen overy the warsaw law firm that advised enron poland s lenders they are pushing envelopes all the time that is especially true in a market withovercapacity where an energy law didn t even exist untilsays peter bisztyga emerging europe utilities analyst at solomon smith barney in londonbecause enron signed a ppa they are ok but i m really not sure building nowa sarzyna was such a good idea mr bisztyga says enron could have generated a faster return by renovating an existing power plant but he acknowledges nowa sarzyna allowed enron to get into the polish market early and stamp their name on it inpolish power plants weren t for sale energy asset privatization discussed for years began in earnest only this year bythe polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of power plantsdistribution companies and the polish power grid akilometer national transmission network of highvoltage lines the assets have a total book value ofbillion zlotys billion euros but murky regulations have driven prices down the regulations don t promote competition and so you don t really know the price of electricity says bengt wegemo president of vattenfall poland earlier this year vattenfall paidmillion forin warsawbased elektrocieplownie warszawskie promisingmillion in investment in the heatandpower plant over the nextyears investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing ultimatelylicensed energy traders andlarge power users will trade on the bourse setting the wholesale price of electricity the polish bourse will be modeled on its nordic counterpart enron the nord pool s largest trader hopes to post polish trading profits bybut first say market experts poland senergy law must be amended to ease functioning of the bourse and free up access to poland s distribution network further the government says it must solve the competition problem posed by the polish power grid s powerpurchase agreements which account forof energy sales in poland some stateowned plants used the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing when prices are freed these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete with plants that didn t spend money to modernize the government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the modernized plants for their extra costs though nowa sarzyna is a private plant the price enron must charge for its power is about twice what outmoded plants charge we are hoping that continuous efficient operation of the plant will generate us a bigger profit mr astramowicz says another problem is crossborder power trading where contradictory legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the polish power grid also known as pse enron and others protest that pse shouldn t compete with electricitymarket participants who contract with it for transmission service pse intends to stay in the trading business says marek zerka pse s vice president in late march pse and local company kulczyk holding signed an agreement with preussenelektra ag of germany to export electricity and coal to eu countries via germany this is great news mr astramowicz says if this joint venture gets access to pse s crossborder transmission capacity i would expect pse to confirm open access to all market participants enron and others are pushing hard for that access as soon as the market becomes open free and nondiscriminatory we will come out at a decent profit mr astramowicz says folder nameenron in europe relevance score on scale ofto review or revise your folder visit httpwww djinteractive com or
