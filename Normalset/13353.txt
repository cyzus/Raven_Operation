williams iii bill nonprivileged pst billfollowing are two glitches the real time group has run across with the forward obs report as i understand dave poston is getting set to roll out a new version of enpower position manager which may eventually take the place of many of the reports we run forward obs included but in the meantime these are the problems we ve seen thanks so much for your help on thisreport not reading two identical stripswhen deals are extended in scheduling for the same hours same volume same price and same counterparty using the same deal number the report only reads one strip for example ondealwas previously entered as a sale to the california imbalance formw heand two separate but identical strips ofmw for hethe report read allmw hebut onlymw hei zeroed out onemw strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read allmw another example ondealis a purchase from ees hewhich was also entered as two separate strips ofmw each again the report read only one of these and i eventually zeroed out one strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read a total ofmw for those hours due to the nature of real time deal entryhigh volume and a lot of deal extension in schedulingit would be impractical to aggregate volumes within deals that fall in the same hours at the same price so i m hoping this can be remedied by tweaking the report to read strips with identical terms please let me know if this is feasiblereport not reading sales at the bc borderthis is a new one that cropped up this morning we made a purchase from a counterparty at the bpa busbar wheeled the power to the bc border and sold it there for some reason although all three dealsappear in deal entry and scheduling the sale at the bc border does not show up in the forward obligation report after looking into this i ve found no deal entry errors and can only conclude that dealis simply not pulling into the report i m wondering if this is related to deals done at the bc border although i don t recall seeing this problem before again please let me know when and if these report problems can be addressed i look forward to our next conference call thanks kate symes real time trading support
