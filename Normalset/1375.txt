 Please read the following message from Dan Reck regarding WebModal Thank youForwarded by Cathy Phillips HOU ECT onAMDaniel ReckPM ToCathy Phillips HOU ECT ECT ccSubjectWebModal At Monday s EGM meeting Mike McConnell asked me to describe the WebModal acquisition EGM made last week Following is a brief description of the freight capacity market and what WebModal gets usMarket The US market for logistics is bn annually We are pursuing the largest homogenous segment which is longhaul truckload and intermodal That market isbn annually depending on who you ask and whether you include dedicated fleets The interesting thing about these markets is that they are extremely fragmented and massively intermediated There are over trucking companies carriers in the US and thousands of independent brokers brokers in this market act as credit principalsof all loads are conducted in the spot market brokered and the rest are done underyear contracts that are generally nonfirm but define the relationship between each shipper and their chosen carriers or intermediaries On the rail side the US railroads act as wholesalers selling their capacity to Intermodal Marketing Companies IMCs The IMCs then retail or broker out that capacity to shippers The difficult part of ground intermodal is that the rail haul makes up only the longhaul component The trip from the origin warehouse to the origin rail yard and then the delivery from the destination rail yard to the destination warehouse has to be done by truck This first and last mile transportation is called drayage WebModal WebModal developed a system to price and schedule intermodal moves so they look identical to truck They have a database with prices and schedules from all the RRs anddrayage companies that gives them complete US coverage A buyer can type in their scheduling and equipment requirements and receive instantaneous quotes for zipcode to zipcode service Because of the inherently different cost and performance structures of rail and truck the pricing differences between the two modes of transportation is significant For any move greater thanmiles intermodal is generallyless expensive than a single driver truck move The substitutability of intermodal and truckload should allow us to trade the spread in price The WebModal acquisition gets us a team with tremendous industry expertise and a good head start as we enter this market The next move will be to build a truck intermediation capability I encourage you to meet Chris Kravas the CEO of WebModal He will be spending all of his time in Houston when he is not on the road Please give me a call if you have any questions Thanks Dan Reck
