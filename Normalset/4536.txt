 matt ben i am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up unify response and retrieve times based on my interviews of various desks including aep and calgary and our recent discussions we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month requirements contracts on wellhead gas following is a recap of what is proposed to be done regarding zero path terminationall paths that are zero on the last day of a month exception noted inbelow will terminate on that day and will no longer roll into the following month this path termination out function will run every night any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month s paths unless a volume is on that path in the future monthzero paths marked as always send nominations will continue to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option it appears that hplpaths and nigaspaths might have some paths rolling that no longer need to a special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the scheduler when you are readyzero paths which roll from month to month using the volume management do not send function will cease to do so this was agree to by patti in regards to paths for oba tracking all please respond via email with any comments richard x
