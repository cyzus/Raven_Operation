 here s some more original message fromlake stephanslake anl gov enron [mailto imceanotes lake c stephan cslake anl egov e enron enron com] sentwednesday april pm toperlman beth ccbetten paul r subjectfwargonne collaboratory research beth per my other note see enclosed the computational science related projects the point here was to explore the possible development and marketing of very high bandwidth services such as teleimmersion telepresence and various collaboratory techniques computational power on demand from large computational grids which could be bought and sold like electricity is another project under development at the lab again both ideas involve collaborations between our organizations to develop new approaches that enron could transform into new commodity items that could be traded i also am interested in exploring new approaches in energy storage via new generation flywheel energy storage systems that would be installed at substations these units would allow companies to store power at night while rates and demand are lower and then use it during peak periods the idea here is that this would provide more power as needed without new electrical infrastructures these systems could be used again as a new commodity electric power storage space all of these items are in the development stage but with sufficient additional funding and technical collaboration from enron and its partner companies new value from new services could be generated we also are a leader in developing high temperature superconductivity wire for use in electric power cables which will enable considerably more power to move through the same space this will enable areas that are power strapped and space constrained such as in large urban areas to push more electricity without very expensive upgrades to the related infrastructure such as roads sidewalks buildings etc i have provided a few urls below for your associates review our homepage is at httpwww anl gov which is the launch site for much of the information on the labs capabilities we also have a software shop under the technology transfer button on the top row middle section which might be of

collaboratories a bit but the links you bring me to a page that cannot be displayed do you have an alternative url addressthanks ross original message fromlake stephanslake anl gov enron [mailto imceanotes lake c stephan cslake anl egov e enronenron com] senttuesday march pm tomesquita ross subjectargonne collaboratory research ross i enjoyed talking with you today regarding your business as we discussed i m attaching a few url s that describe our research in various collaboratory and immersive environments httpwwwunix mcs anl gov doe collabs html httpwwwfp mcs anl gov division research html the goal of this work is develop technology to assist collaboratory actions over high bandwidth environments scientists engineers designers and probably bankers lawyers accountants and other professional staff will have significant new tools in forming and working a collaboration forum the bulk of this research is done in our mathematics and computer science division you may also notice an additional collaboratory activity which is telepresence in this case scientists can remotely manipulate scientific equipment such as electronic microscopes as well as discuss the results with others as the experiment is underway this approach actually allows collaborating parties to reach out and control machines safely over the internet this is far beyond just changing a camera angle or moving a microscope stage i ve also included a url on the computational grid concept which provides heavy computational power on demand in a way not dissimiliar to the electric generation and distribution business httpglobus org if your clients are faced with the need to access enormous files of hard copy information that needs to be put in a manner that can used easily over the internet we have developed an interesting approach doe has over pages of hard copy documents from various sources on the human radiation experiments conducted over many years these documents can easily be accessed and manipulated through an special search engine our other information research division the decision information sciences division built and operated this application you can view it athttpwww dis anl gov disweb datt as a side note this division has unique skills in developing technology to solve problems that have enormous amounts of date the division also has developed energy planning software and trained many foreign government energy planners on the use of that software regards steve lake argonne national laboratory
