 Dear Rick Thanks for the update I appreciate your input as I do not know what your discussions with Rick Buy have been To address your points below I agree that your team should be involved in the planning of each individual review although I am under the impression that Ted Sally by proxy Cassandra and I would set the scope timing of the reviews while your group would be looped in to the planning for each individual process If my understanding is incorrect please let me knowI agree that it would be useful for everyone to attend all meetings However due to the limited time we have from arriving at the doorstep to delivery of the report to Ted and Sally your group really has to be focused on completing the deal test We don t need three different people obtaining the same information at the same meetings If there has been a change in your group s role from what I originally understood we need lower level people from your team who would be able to execute a deal test we may have to add additional resources to do the actual deal test to ensure it is done on time by the time we leave the siteAgreedI d like to hear what Donna and Mike Neeves have resolved as far as the database is concerned before we meet again Best regards Shona ToShona Wilson NA Enron ENRON ccTed Murphy HOU ECT ECT Sally Beck HOU ECT ECT Cassandra Schultz NA Enron Enron Lynn Bellinghausen ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENt Donna Lowry HOU ECT ECT SubjectReupdates to processes ShonaThank you for your memo I think it is a good idea to define roles and responsibilities and I appreciate the fact that you have taken the initiative to do so However I do have the following comments I have some accountability to Rick Buy for the success of this effort therefore I or my designee need to be involved in Doorstep pre planning and postmortem I will be involved in reviewing the final report before presentation and will attend the meeting when the report is presented to Buy and CauseyI realize that in the interest of getting a review done timely it is sometimes necessary to divide and conquer However where logistically possible I believe that it makes sense for my people to be involved in meetings held with Commercial personnel This facilitates understanding operations document flow points of contact report writing as well as furthering our goal of educating multifunctional people so that we can continue to reduce the resources necessary to perform these reviewsThere are still some detailed issues that need to be clarified regarding the database Let s schedule another meeting with Cassandra and Donna Please let me know if you have any questions Regards Rick
