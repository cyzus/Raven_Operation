 attached below is the cpuc s proposed decision in the gas industryrestructuring proceeding essentially it adopts the interim proposal withafew modifications the cpuc states that they are taking a cautious approach to deregulation in light of recent market events in both electricityand gas and therefore rejected the more robust reforms outlined in thecomprehensive settlement the cs was offered by socal gas and supported bymany of the settlement parties including enron and transwestern the good news is that with respect to hector road the maximum volume athector is limited tommcf d similar to the proposal made by thecomprehensive settlement i ve included the section from the pd that dealswith this issue for your convenience the full document is also attached excerpt at at pageregarding hector road receipt points intrastate transmission as we have already discussed above we now judge that intrastate transmissionunbundling is not wise at this time for the socalgas system however socalgasintrastate transmission system can still be made more accessibleand understandable to its users in rthe record reflects dissatisfaction among customers andshippers with the lack of clarity on how socalgas schedules gas shipmentsthrough its windowing system and socalgassole use of the hector roadinterconnection as a receipt point exhin rpp southern california edison company market

resolution we reach today prehearing conference of september pwe are approving on an interim basis the replacement of the current windowingprocess with a system under which socalgas will establish receipt pointcapacities subject to daily revision on the basis of the physical maximumsfor each receipt point under the operating conditions expected for that daycustomers and shippers will know the daily maximums because they will beposted on socalgasgasselect system daily prior to the nominationdeadlines if in the aggregate customers nominate more than the physicalcapacity at any receipt point gas will be scheduled based on the upstreampipelines capacity rights system for wheeler ridge at which more than oneupstream pipeline delivers gas the maximum daily physical capacity would beallocated between upstream sources pro rata on the basis of the prior daysscheduled deliveries from each source this system eliminates the mystery in how prorations are made providescontinuity in capacity rights between the interstate and intrastate systemsand provides flexibility for customers in nominating at the mostcosteffective receipt point on any given day we recognize that it does notprovide for longterm planning but the alternative under the cs of paidforfirm receipt point rights for the term of the settlement has the disadvantageof locking customers into a receipt point that may lose value over the termin this period of gas price volatility we believe that the more flexibleplan is the right one thus we direct socalgas to withdraw advice letterand file a new adviceletter withinbusiness days implementing the proposed receipt pointphysical capacity system this may be the same as the exemplary tariff filedwith the is or updated as necessary pursuant to subsequent proceedings thistariff revision will be effective withindays after the filing unlessrejected by the energy division in rpg e and edison particularly complained about therestrictions at wheeler ridge exhin rpppg erebuttal to market conditions report and exhin rpp southern california edison market conditions report one response in theis to these complaints is the establishment of a formal receipt point athector road for all customers subject to wheeler ridge access fees andsurcharges its capacity will bemmcfd or greater as long as there arenominations of that volume and mojave pipeline company delivers that much inresponse to those nominations this provision should allow greaterflexibility for shippers and customers as well as leveling the playing fieldbetween socalgas and others at this interconnection we will supportsocalgasapplication to the federal energy regulatory commission forapproval of hector road as a formal delivery point by mojave el paso natural gas company objected strongly to the provision in the is forautomatically expanding of wheeler ridge capacity while this was not anoption specifically mentioned in dwe do not choose to stand onthat technicality to exclude it from consideration here once a proceedingis open to settlement the dynamics of settlement talks may bring in mattersoutside the delineated scope as they have done here with regard to wheelerridge expansion and for instance pooling both proposals respond toconcerns raised in rsee citations in text above as well as panelhearing testimony of mr benjamin c campbell pg e tr ppjan and neither was specifically excluded from further consideration indwe therefore view them as within the scope of this proceedingto the extent that other receipt points are also viewed as constrained wewelcome evidence to that effect in a future proceeding as well as proposalsfor criteria to determine when expansion should be applied for by mmcfdif a certain number of curtailments occurred and for automatically allowingthe expenses of that expansion to be rolled into rates we do not wish toapprove automatic rate increases for all ratepayers for a facility for whichonly some may have use but we believe that developing criteria for expansionof receipt points is useful hector road may not entirely alleviate theproblem of constraints on northern gas flowing to the south therefore we approve that portion of section iii of the is that sets forthcriteria for expansion but provide that upon the meeting of that criteria socalgas shall submit an application for an expansion of the receipt pointcapacity that application shall be processed in the regular way with theissues of need in the context of the entire system and foreseeable marketconditions considered moreover rolledin or incremental rates allocationof cost among classes and consequent rate design will remain open fordecision in that proceeding thus the modification to the is that we make is in the first sentence of

since the pd empowers the likes of norm and florio itwill be important to play very close attention to implementation of hector sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news but we have a knack
