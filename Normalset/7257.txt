appears to still be on a roll in terms of its financial performance in contrast enron faced anunprecedented year of turmoil and is presently languishing in a low ebb characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the company s financial reporting while the two companies operate in the same market space of power trading and are fierce competitors dynegyironically theyounger and smaller of the two companiesis an industry success story while enron s status remains rather uncertain the questions to be addressed inthis article arewhat is dynegy doing right what is enron doing wrongwhat lessons can other power and naturalgas marketers learn from this tale of two companies although they are often referred to as crosstown rivals dynegy and enron are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions their divergentapproaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the singlemost important element related to their disparate positions at the end ofput more simply the two companies have vastly different strategies andhindsight beinga strong argument can be made that dynegy s strategy is the winner at this juncture throughout this article i will focus on two key areas in which dynegy and enron differ dramatically those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to which the companies have expanded and invested into noncore sectors both companies started out as naturalgas companies and converged into the power market in the s however that is essentially where their similarities end and over the last few years enron and dynegy have followed decidedly different paths in an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary let me summarize the two paths this wayenron does not believe it needs to own physical assets to be a success in the power and naturalgas trading sector; dynegy on the other hand not only believes in the ownership of physical assets but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry let s look at the companies separately we ll discuss enron first since it is the older of the two enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define but a close approximation is that enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers theparticipation and success in commodity markets according to enron does not necessitate ownership of physical assets in fact the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business rather enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues as an example enron bought portland general which owns mw of generation and kilometers of electric t d lines inas a way to launch its penetration of the west coast power markets when competition fizzledin that region enron put portland general back on the sales block a saleof portland general to northwest natural is pending at this writing likewise in europe where it is one of the most prominent trading companies enron has disposed of generation assets such as sutton bridge in england and unlike other u s competitors has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as germany and italy according to itsmost recent k report filed with the securities and exchange commission enron owns or controls mw of generating capacity including joint ownerships which is drastically lower than the average among other companiesoperating in the power trading sector dynegy s approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from enron s in the words of ceo chuck watson dynegy s longterm strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets which supportsearnings sustainability ever since going public indynegy has beenon an acquisition binge with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability dynegy presently owns or controls about mw of generating capacity in the united statesgasprocessing plants and miles of pipelines which are located in geographically competitive areas the company s goal is to own or control mw orpercent of the u s market within the next five years sometimes dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as nrg energy but just as often it has purchased assets independently most notably when dynegy acquired illinova in earlythe purchase doubled dynegy s generating capacity dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in europe where it is presently planning to purchase naturalgas storage facilities in england dynegy executives have argued that naturalgas storage is the best way to back up a naturalgas trading operation there s no question that theapproach is working out of themillion that dynegy reported in the third quartermillion of it came from the company s main wholesale business the issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between enron and dynegy and its significance should not be overlooked it is not difficult to make a case that supports dynegy s approach owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets andanticipate small changes in price in other words by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells atrader such as dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to bein a particular region how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur in addition in markets that are short on infrastructure it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the marketunless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region by the same token those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators and possible insight to spreads the difference between various energy prices in fact dynegy s ceo watsonfully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist this may be more difficult for a company such as enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies inpower bids dynegy s strategy of acquiring both naturalgas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities on the other side of this argument a case could be made that enron s approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility certainly by investing less in power generation facilities enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like dynegy under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop a company such as enron that does not have heavycapital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an assetladen company because enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility assetheavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility as the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottomline results this could be seen as a potential concern for investors further some would argue that enron s approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility what enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not beingtied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio consequently the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the great debate among power traders however although dynegy s overall performance in the third quarter was better than enron s that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of dynegy s strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities keep in mind that enron s q losses resulted primarilyfrom nonrecurring charges related to its noncore businesses broadband and water in particular without these charges enron s core wholesale trading business continues to perform well this is a point that ceo ken lay has been quick to reiterate to investors our percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our naturalgas pipelines lay said the continued excellent prospects in these businesses and enron s leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook moreover perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between dynegy and enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies approach to developing new lines of business telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point enron which prides itself as usually gaining a firststrike advantage plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies under the leadership of thenceo jeffrey skilling enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative now lay admits that the company could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital and that enron spent too muchtoo soon in this sector nevertheless enron recorded an million nonrecurring writedown for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector tomillion a quarter dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecomsector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to enron dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector but in the third quarter took a million loss in its broadband business compared to the million loss that enron reported however dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities electricityand natural gas and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business it is also important to note that enron gained the firststrike advantage when it developed enrononline an electronic trading exchange in fact enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space well ahead of its competitors dynegy later followed this trend with creating dynegydirect the two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors the latest available information indicates that enrononline has recorded transactions that exceedin notional value since its inception in novemberdynegydirect has recordedbillion in notional transactions at this juncture dynegy and enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting enron which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors is currently struggling froma serious image problem as the securities and exchange commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by enron s cfo to my recollection no one has ever accused dynegy of not providing a balance sheet and thus the company s status with investors is arguably more solid as i don t expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy anytime soon my projection is that at least in the near term we will continue to see a wide disparity in wall street performance between dynegy and enron that is not to say that anyone should count enron out of the game as noted the company s core business of wholesale business remains strong but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other noncore businesses that doesn t mean enron is down permanently but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former ceo jeffrey skilling believed were advantageous in many ways the comparison between dynegy and enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable i am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy the race between the two is far from over although dynegy is taking the lead at this point based on its more methodical approach what will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies correction statement to issuealert on european tradingaccording to a news report from reuters the u s owned entergykoch trading was listed as a publicly traded company
