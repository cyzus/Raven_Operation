 louise i thoroughly enjoyed our telephone conversation several weeks ago as promised i am following up with some thoughts on how we might best use the time i have on your calendar next week i am very much looking forward to the visit with you and some of your team members joining me on the visit will be yoko sugiura selden she works with me in my consulting business and is also helping me with the course she is a former investment banker and joined my firm after we were married i thought i might indicate some of the discussion areas i would like to explore just to remind you i have launched a brand new course at columbia university graduate school of business titled internet financial management the theme of the course is how companies can use the internet to create sustained excess shareowner returns this theme applies equally to pureplay bb and bc companies as well as to the bulk of traditional companies that are trying to figure out how best to leverage the internet in their normal course of business to describe this process i have used the term etizing by that i mean the total transformation of a firm s business processes such that all relevant operations and communications whether they are internal i e among operating units and functions or external i e between a firm and its customers suppliers and alliance partners are performed on the internet obviously the decision of where to etize and where not to is ultimately an roi question by the way ge uses the term digitizing for roughly the same notion in order to make the course experience for the students especially valuable and to provide a much broader exposure for columbia in the internet area i have departed from the typical course format in two key ways first since everything is moving too quickly for a textbook to exist i have assembled a worldclass group of lecturers who have kindly agreed to make the time to join us second the students are grouped in teams to work on specific action learning projects with corporate sponsors in addition geoff colvin of fortune and i are writing up the lecturers and will craft them into a series of fortune articles so far we have been very fortunate the speakers have been extremely accommodating and absolutely outstanding in both content and deliverynot to create any pressure to give you a feel terry jones the ceo of travelocity will be spending a good deal of time on this coming monday discussing the implications of what he has learned in creating one of the most effective internet sales and marketing machines for traditional companies that sell to consumers as further background the student teams are working with applied materials travelocity trilogy and barnes noble com this small set of companies represents a nice cross section of bb bc and more traditional brick and mortar companies irrespective of the company setting each student team will be focusing on projects that deal with using the internet to create sustained excess shareowner returns the target fortune audience will also cover a broad cross section of companies but with an emphasis on traditional nonpure play internet enterprises louise with respect to your presentation i would like for you to explore a fairly specific set of issues so that a the student teams will be able to use the learnings to leverage their projects with their sponsor companies and b the series of lectures will mesh together very effectively for our writing for fortune for the nonpure play internet companies i want to use ge and enron as best practice examples i have been meeting extensively with the ge folks and am beginning to get a pretty good handle on what they are doing today and what they are likely to be doing over the next few years in the same vein i view my visit to enron as having three primary goalsi getting to know you and some of the enron management team ii getting a good understanding of how your business is using the internet to create shareowner value and iii establishing a working outline for your session in april clearly i and especially ii will form the basis for iii i have scheduled the following times with tammie to meet with you and or your teamfebruary louise work on ii and plan for febfebruary work with other team members february louise review learnings and plan iii a sampling of the kinds of questions i would like to investigate would be the following is the essence of what you have accomplished the creation of a totally new business or etizing a preexisting business how pervasive is the use of the internet in the daytoday running of enronfor example has enron gone the route of cisco and ge in trying to etize sufficiently to close your books globally on a daily basis to what extent is the approach of your business to the internet creating or forcing compatibility of technology information systems between you and your customers i e trading partnersand suppliers participants in the physical value chain we discussed the critical role of process definition and detailed mapping to your success could you outline for us the process and what are themajor success factors andfailure factors from a technology perspective i believe you mentioned that you first looked outside for a solution and found that typical erp type approaches would have required such massive modifications that you felt starting from scratch would be more valuable i would like to discuss that in more detail also how did you systematically tackle the taskwhat was the timelinehaving been through the experience what are the key learnings for next timewhat not to do what to do more off and how to go faster also on the technology level i would be very interested in learning about the full set of technology building blocksincluding telecom hardware servers routers etc storage software and hardware content software also along those lines what are the costscapital setup and maintenanceshould this beorof revenue how is the overall technology investment managed so as to get optimal synergies and yet not impinge on the distinctive diverse needs of various different businesses in enron how are you measuring customer supplier and operational metrics differently due to your internet effortshow has this change the form content and use of your financialsafter reading this email if you have any thoughts please don t hesitate to give me a callor send an email message yoko and i are really looking forward to our visit thanks in advance best regards larry
