williams iii bill nonprivileged pst realtimersarco is going down for a few hours in the morning on thursday to conduct some maintenance they are prescheduled at mw but from hethey will only be able to produce mw so please reduce their generation schedule and purchase mw he in sp for them also for he of those mw that you purchase for arco please sell mw to st west services deal and then sell to arco deal for the same price that you sold to west services the remainder just sell straight to arco this needs to be done because there were some funky schedule adjustments by the iso basically the iso cut arco s dayahead schedule by mw for he so west services had wear that in order for the dayahead enpower to caps report to tie out one more thing the iso also adjusted several other generator schedules for he on thursday i emailed the generators who were affected sierra wheelabrator martel and nove i told them that we resubmitted all their schedules in the hour ahead market and that we were relatively confident that their preferred schedules would be awarded hour ahead but if they so desired they could call into the realtime desk one hour before the flow to check the hourahead final that way the could make any adjustments to their generation if necessary so you might get a few calls in the middle of the night from a few generators to check their final hourahead schedules but to be honest i highly doubt you ll get any calls i know you won t get a call from nove or sierra if you do get a call it might be from wheelabrator martel thanks a bunch stan
