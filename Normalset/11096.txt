 pg e to expand pacific northwest system responding to tight energy supplies in the pacific northwest and california pg e corp s national energy group revealed plans wednesday to begin an open season early next year kicking off a fiveyear expansion effort the first phase would addmmcf d of firm transportation capacity out of western canada on its gas transmissionnorthwest gtn pipeline system the pg e gtn group expects the phase one expansion to be in service by novemberat the latest as we have been anticipating the western natural gas market is at a critical point in the need for additional pipeline capacity said thomas b king president of the pg e national energy group pg e neg west region gas supplies into the pacific northwest and california are very tight at the same time the market is strong and growing and the pg e gas transmission northwest pipeline system has been operating at or near maximum capacity levels for the greater part of the year we believe gtn is now positioned for an aggressive expansion period that will result in additional supplies of natural gasat competitive transportation ratesin this region for both directuse customers and electric generation byking noted that the phase one expansion of the gtn system was brought on primarily because of the state of disarray in the california market he cited the growing use of gas to fuel electric generating facilities as the main reason new capacity is needed king added that the gtn pipeline system is the most direct and economic link for tapping the canadian production basins and bringing the load to california and the pacific northwest markets he also emphasized that the expansions would help the market prepare for new supply from alaska we are constantly talking to our customers about what is the right time for us to expand our pipeline system said sandra mcdonough spokeswoman for pg e corp with the power plant development both in california and in the pacific northwest including plants in the northwest that are being built right next to our pipeline the time is clearly now to start expanding the system we have gotten more bids for capacity than we have been able to move recently mcdonough told daily gpi last week that the company was looking to expand its mainline in the near future see daily gpi decto gauge demand pg e neg plans to launch an open season for themmcf d expansion of the mainline beginning on jan bids are due by feb following the open season the company will hold a capacity rationalization period which will allow existing shippers to release capacity directly to customers who have expressed an interest the mile dual pipe gtn system begins at the idahobritish columbia border travels through northern idaho southeastern washington and central oregon and terminates at the oregoncalifornia border where it connects with the pacific gas and electric co intrastate pipeline system currently the gtn system is the largest u s transporter of canadian natural gas with bcf d of capacity the expansion was deemed necessary because the average contract term on the line extends throughand the pipeline has been operating at capacity or near capacity for most ofthe method of expansion had not been decided on yet but it is expected to include additional compression and some looping mcdonough said pg e has been in contact with its upstream providers including transcanada pipelines limited tcpl to ensure coordination of capacity doug baldwin ceo of tcpl said transcanada will work with pg e neg to examine and if appropriate satisfy the needs of market participants in both the western united states and canada if response to the open season is adequate pg e neg hopes to move along with the project immediately the novemberin service date includes an anticipated oneyear process to obtain a federal energy regulatory commission ferc permit we also expect to have an incrementalmmcf d of new directconnect gasfired electric generation load along the gtn system in the pacific northwest by mid king said we expect to follow theproject immediately with additional pipeline expansions to meet the need for additional gas supplies in the pacific northwest on both the east and west sides of the cascade mountains for the next fivetoeight years pg e corp expects to be busy with pipeline expansions and new additions the company has planned a second mainline expansion to be in service inwith a new interconnect near spokane wa which will serve the puget sound seattle area the last expansion phase will be brought online sometime afterwith alaskan gas fields expected to be ready for commercial service in the next five toyears pg e neg will build an expansion that will facilitate transportation of gas from alaska and canada s northwest territories to markets in the lowerstates overall what we are looking at is the potential to expand the system bybcf d over the next decade mcdonough said
