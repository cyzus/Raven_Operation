next month may represent the low for the remainder of the year gas storagenot yet enough mild weather over much of the united states during july allowed a muchneeded recovery in storage injections with the estimated injection rate increasing by nearly bcf per day from yearearlier levels see tablethis rate was enabled entirely by lower demand however and not added supply the result is that under more normal summer weather conditions during august the us storage inventory deficit is likely to remain stubbornly nearbcf although the deficit is likely to decline on average during august it is even more likely to expand again during september especially should any storm necessitate evacuation of offshore platforms absolute inventories and supply adequacy for this winter therefore remain a concern in the market inventories are unlikely to reach levels adequate to prevent record lows from occurring next spring should injections continue as expected inventories would reach approximately bcf by october ; but reaching even this level still an alltime low annual maximum inventory requires some help from a lack of storm activity and a lack of heating load in october storage inventories are not yet sufficient to relieve market pressure and are unlikely to become so by the beginning of the heating season regional marketswestern disconnects continue wide differentials emerged this summer in the west and look likely to persist through september in southern california record summer demand levels have pushed pipeline flows to new highs topock continues to be the premium pricing point in north america in the rockies supply growth has pushed up pipeline flows out of the region power loads should ease somewhat in southern california and that easing will bring some decline in the topock premium pressure on rocky mountains and san juan prices should persist until the start of the heating season in late october see tablecera s outlook by region followsrockies pipeline capacity out of the rockies is running nearly full to every export market except the san juan basin emerging pipeline bottlenecks should keep differentials wide during september with an average differential of per mmbtu san juan in the san juan increased imports from the rocky mountains and high utilization rates on capacity into california are pressuring prices cera expects differentials to average per mmbtu for the month of september san juan differentials will narrow more substantially when rocky mountain pipeline bottlenecks are relieved by increases in heating demand during the fourth quarter permian and midcontinent strong power loads in texas have supported permian basin prices during july and august persistent power demand is expected to keep differentials around per mmbtu for september midcontinent prices should average just under permian prices chicago steady storage injection loads are unlikely to support prices at chicago in the face of declining power generation into september july premiums of to have already come down in early august and are likely to remain low at approximately for september northeast markets northeast price premiums have averaged from the mids to the mids depending on generation load and proximity to the new york facilities group major meters cera expects little to change this relationship but as generation loads decline into september premiums could move closer to the fuel cost floor the mid to highs canadian marketssupply growth still disappointing although june displayed yearoveryear growth in production in western canada july reverted to a decline and august is running close to last year s level the current expectation is for over well completions inapproximately of which are expected to be gas wells even if the trend toward shallow drilling does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is expected to produce a supply build by yearend and intoforthe total western canadian supply build is expected to be flat withincreasing to a positive growth ofmmcf per day indemand slow but exports up transcanada flows are downmmcf per day on average forbut have been down by overmmcf per day so far in the third quarter pg e gtnw volumes were up by overmmcf per day in june and july but have dropped to yearearlier levels in august and are expected to remain close to last year s levels for september northern border pipeline is operating at rates similar to last year s on average inbut is expected to decrease aboutmmcf per day for the third quarter western canadian demand is currently up slightly driven by the warmerthannormal weather in late july and early august but should be closer tolevels in september high priceswide differentials the aecohenry differential has widened quite dramatically over the past few months from the low uss of the first quarter to us in july the differential increased to well over a dollar in the second week of august but the driver for that increase was maintenance that reduced the export capacity at empress august and september are expected to average in the mids aeco is expected to average c per gigajoule gj us per mmbtu for august with september softening to c per gj us per mmbtu for a third quarter average of c per gj us per mmbtu end follow url for pdf version of this monthly briefing with associated tables account changes to edit your personal account information including your email address etc go tohttpeprofile cera com cfm edit account cfm this electronic message and attachments if any contain information from cambridge energy research associates inc cera which is confidential and may be privileged unauthorized disclosure copying distribution or use of the contents of this message or any attachments in whole or in part is strictly prohibited terms of usehttpwww cera com tos html questions commentswebmaster cera com copyrightcambridge energy research associates
