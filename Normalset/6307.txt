 aep agrees with the idea that once we close they would begin paying us rent for the space and furniture but this would not recover all our costs i estimate a cost of k but it is worth it to close early and save mm per month in labor overhead and capital costs brian louise kitchenam tobrian redmond hou ect ect ccsubjectrepossible temporary move of hpl tolouisiana do we get any recompense for

hawthorn enron enronxgate heather a johnson enron enronxgate subjectpossible temporary move of hpl tolouisiana i finished the walk through of the th floor space located atlouisiana this afternoon on the walk through with me were paul foust facilities robert humlicek jeffrey vincent and andrew hawthorn i previously talked with deborah bubenko and vincent fox about this space comments from the review are as followsmost of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas conference rooms etc included the floor can accommodate up topeople however with this amount of people in the area space will be very tight almost all offices will need to hold at least two people large offices will need to hold three or four the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space with maximum doubling up in the offices you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers as tommy stated in his earlier email on the allen center space the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants one area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor the floor plan shows approximatelydesks on the floor some offices were locked so we could not verify the total however this number appears correct also for the most part there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied chairs filing cabinets credenzas etc would needed to be added to this space we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from there is one large area withcubicles forming a circle according to paul this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant this might work for the trading area the room appears to have the most telephone connectivity is open and would accommodate up toif we decide trader telephones are necessary record conversations etc the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule the floor has two data closets at least one of the closets hashour air conditioning according to vincent this floor has the same server connectivity at the three allen center space ameg single mode fiber connection serves this space robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up toports however this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete probably some cabling will need to be added it appears that the space can accommodate up tousers even with the extra ports needed for network printers laptops etc however if we need to accommodate more thanports additional switches can be added in summary the floor space atlouisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at three allen center russell s long enron net works llc russell long enron comembedded stdolelink embedded stdolelink
