williams iii bill nonprivileged pst let s try something a little bit different regarding real time deal disputes when virginia and mike receive a dispute from houston they ll file the pertinent information in a drawer marked dms to the right of my desk in a folder with your name on it please consult this folder at the beginning of every shift to determine whether you have any trades to clear up and how many sometime over the course of your shift take a minute to address the discrepancy make strides to resolve it if it happens to be more complicated than an intrashift fix talk to me so we can determine what needs to be done to expediate its resolution pull tapes pull our hair out etc the most important step of this new procedure is postoptell someone what you ve done sign the corresponding dms sheet and write a legible explanation of measures taken on the back return it to virginia mike or me whatever you do don t leave without a trace i d like to know if this sounds like a feasible plan; so feedback is welcome in the meantime this procedure will be effective immediately some of you already have disputes in your files enjoy thanks kate
