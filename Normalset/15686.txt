 hi guys i need some advice sharad is in the process of finding differences between your and our versions of exotica at some point we will need to migrate london office over to your more uptodate version and i m concerned that there may be racstyle implications i m in favour of using the it testers to carry out formal regression testing and they are apparently able to do this do we need to get our heads together to form a view before we involve rac or the business groupsanjam tells sharad that london exotica was built using exceland that neither he nor zimin knows how to build compile the xla using later versions of excel is this trueif so then we need to migrate to xlls sooner rather than later because of the maintenance implications steve
