barrionuevo staff reporter of the wall street journalthe wall street journal c copyright cdow jones company inc in the wake of last month s terrorist attacks naturalgas prices have slid belowper million british thermal units frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in naturalgas projects analysts predict that with prices at current levels projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the u s could be shelved or canceled naturalgas prices which reached highs of nearlyper million btus last december had held to aroundtoper million btus for much of the year atper million btus and below producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electricutility demand nearby november futures fellcents yesterday to on the new york mercantile exchange in the boston area

terrorists already relative to other areas naturalgas prices have inched higher in new england where naturalgas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market the spread between prices in new england and the gulf coast widened last week bycents to per million btus said a spokeswoman for distrigas a unit of belgium s tractebel sa but the lack of lng isn t likely to become a big issue until winter hits and naturalgas storage is used up richard grant ceo of distrigas says lng has a year safety record at the company s everett mass terminal while lng is flammable he says it is unlikely to explode he adds that there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual but until we answer the concerns we won t be able to bring a ship in here deutsche banc alex brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourthquarter projections for naturalgas prices last week prior to septwe were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back said jay saunders a deutsche banc analyst but all that is out the window now deutsche banc is now estimating adrop in winter demand in the industrial sector which accounts for more than a quarter of total u s naturalgas consumption the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage which is on pace to be full by the end of october while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future naturalgas demand is met lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms such as eog resources inc plan to moderate production in the next two months gas drillingrig counts fell tolast week from at the end of august even with the increased naturalgas drilling of earlier this year overall naturalgas supply is expected to increase justthis year as the country s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence still the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form with prices high last winter el paso corp and enron corp among others said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas which is gas compressed and frozen to minus degrees fahrenheit you will see some cancellations and some delays predicts marshall adkins an analyst with raymond james associates in houston naturalgas prices need to averageper million btus on the east coast and on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas said ronald barone an analyst with ubs warburg a spokeswoman for el paso houston says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u s market enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the

business standard after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandrakurla complex enron has been able lease out square feet of it to citibank na against an expected realisation from rscrore for the outright sale of its four floors enron will get around rs crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant cushman wakefield at a monthly rental of rsper square foot with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income enron had eyed a deal of rscrore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs per square foot this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs to rs per square feet in junethe us energy giant had shelled out rs crore when it acquired the four floors plus car park space from wockhardt the pharmaceutical company the deal was struck at rs per sq ft and included parking space forcars industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rscrore to acquire the property and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired in order for it to break even it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs per square foot four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase he added moreover the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super builtup area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises and enron s proposition continues to go abegging said the consultant copyrightdow jones company inc all rights reserved carly fiorina tops
