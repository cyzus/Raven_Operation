 hey guys i had a long talk with ncpa today and set up so that we again can do the zp np buyresale on a realtime basis we are not doing a profit split this time we are paying themmw instead this basically enables us to shift mw across path and not be subject to congestion as ncpa has grandfather rights across the path this is a sweet strategy when the sp np spread is there and path is congested ncpa s capacity is mw but i would not recommend doing more than mw there are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it wesco especially so by doing only mw we do not remind them of ncpa the way this works is that we call ncpa and ask their capacity across path and tell them you want to schedule the br through whatever hour in capswe sell to ncpa in zp we buy from ncpa in np we can buy sp to fill our zp sale we just shift the load from sp to zp so enter a epmi calpool pg e is ncpa s sc so if you are not passing phase two give them a call ncpa s telpg e telif you guys have any questions just ask me geir
