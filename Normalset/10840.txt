waning hydroelectric energy production and the more frequent use of gasfired generators to meet demand causes steadily rising power prices cera expects the west to be the only region in north america with a yearoveryear increase in peak electricity demand power prices already established new record highs in june suggesting that as demand reaches its peak during the coming summer months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year s levels the convergence of natural gas prices that are much higher than last year s levels growing demand for power and reduced hydroelectric energy production when compared with levels inis pushing up western power prices merchant and other gasfired generators will be pressed into service experiencing their strongest utilization rates since the drought year ofgreater utilization of gasfired generators within the west has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout north america western gas prices should continue to be strong boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across north america to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer power loads the main drivers of higher power and gas prices when compared with yearearlier levels will be peak wscc load season summer weather will drive loads to the year s coincident peak which is most likely to occur during the july august period but could arrive any time during the june through october airconditioning season cera expects demand growth of percent in the third quarter compared with levels inwhich will push western systems coordinating council wscc coincident peak demand levels to percent overlevels waning hydroelectric output hydroelectric production is on its normal downward seasonal slide this resource decline is more visible when compared with thehydro season which was both abundant and prolonged high utilization rates for gasfired generators growing demand for electricity coupled with a declining availability of hydroelectric energy will drive utilization rates of gasfired power plants to their highest levels since the drought year ofhigher fuel prices western gas prices have remained at per mmbtu abovelevels growing yearoveryear gas demand for power generation is providing much of the price pressure in western markets these higher gas prices provide a boost to both onpeak and offpeak power prices of betweenandper megawatthour mwh regional power market drivers power markets in the west are poised to break records for demand peak load and gasfired plant utilization and as a result power prices a return to normal summer weather coupled with growing demand for power will push demand for electricity up by gigawatthours gwh in the us west for the third quarter compared withlevels or almost megawatts mw on average see tablethis growth in the demand for electricity will also drive peak loads to new highs cera expects thewscc coincident peak to be exceeded by percent climbing to nearly mw as was demonstrated by the mild summer ofdeviations from normal weather could boost or thwart this peak demand growth figure two key factors will significantly reduce third quarter hydroelectric production levels compared withlevels first cera expects westwide total season hydroelectric production inof roughlypercent of historical average levels substantially lower than the approximatelypercent of average insecond runoff was prolonged inserving to push a substantial portion of the hydroelectric production into the summer period see figureon average cera expects these factors will remove gwh or almost average megawatts amw from the western resource base compared withlevels exacerbating this decline refilling of reservoirs and flow restrictions to assist fish migration will cause periodic but significant curtailments in power production at key pacific northwest hydroelectric facilities natural gasfired facilities will be called upon to supply most of the expected increase in demand while also replacing hydroelectric resources as they continue to decline this will push average annual utilization rates of gasfired combined cycle steam and cogeneration plants to approximatelypercent in levels not experienced since thepercent annual average utilization rate ina year marked by drought and warmerthannormal summer weather utilization rates for these facilities will also surge pastlevels especially this summer cera anticipates a westwide third quarter utilization rate ofpercent for these facilities under normal summer weather conditions compared withpercent for the same period ofthis level of utilization will certainly establish gasfired generation as the floor to power prices during the third quarter during not only the onpeak demand period but the offpeak as well with natural gas prices at per mmbtu higher thanlevels power prices are boosted by per mwh owing to fuel price increases alone with supply tightness already evident in western power markets the stage is set for increased price volatility compared withlevels as episodes of hot weather require increased utilization of lessefficient generators throughout this summer pacific northwest the water supply forecast for the columbia river remains near average but has dropped a couple percentage points from last month flows are expected to remain at roughlypercent of average through september on the lower columbia andpercent of average on the upper columbia conditions overall are still sufficient to be considered average this return to normal conditions in the pacific northwest should produce hydroelectric output nearly gwhpercent lower than last year for july and gwh lower for the third quarter as a whole see tablethe region s load growth coupled with lower hydro supply will continue to elevate power prices in the pacific northwest relative tolevels tighter supply conditions in california and the southwest will attract energy exports from the pacific northwest preserving a differential between the pacific northwest and california of aboutper mwh on average price differentials between the pacific northwest and california have varied dramatically recently with the north at times rising above those to the south owing to local demand and hydroelectric constraints caused by reservoir filling operations since the end of may volatility in both markets has pushed the difference between daily onpeak prices at cob and those in california from a premium ofper mwh to a discount ofper mwh within a few days cera expects that over the long run california markets will clear at a premium as the summer progresses but the differential will vary widely with episodes of pacific northwest power pricing at a premium to those in california california despite belowaverage precipitation and snowpack this year california reservoir storage levels throughout the state are higher than normal ranging betweenandpercent of average for the state s primary runoff regions under these conditions hydroelectric output should be roughlypercentgwh below last year s levels for the third quarter see tablewith a return to normal weather conditions relative to third quartercooling demand this summer will increase most in california where weather was nearlypercent cooler than average last year recent dayahead power prices in california have drawn attention to the west as the highestcost market if only temporarily in north america record high temperatures and unscheduled unit outages produced new dayahead price records with power prices on juneatper mwh in the dayahead onpeak market and realtime hourly prices at the market cap ofper mwh increased utilization of gasfired generation and daily gas prices of aroundper mmbtu burnertip in southern california have kept daily average offpeak prices betweenandper mwh notably these higher price have occurred during periods when roughly mw more coalfire generation was available in the west compared with the same period incera expects prices to continue to respond to the tight capacity environment this summer rockies and southwest during summerthe rockies southwest was the only region to experience aboveaverage cooling demand suggesting that normal weather should bring only moderate demand growth of less thanpercent see tablehowever growing energy demand in neighboring regions and a large transmission transfer capability will pull energy from the rockies southwest region when excess capacity is available ensuring that prices in the region will remain tightly connected to price levels in other parts of the west palo verde prices have generally kept pace with other western markets while maintaining their characteristic premium to the california power exchange during spring and early summer cera expects southwest prices to strengthen relative to california when summer weather periodically shifts the locus of demand to the southwest however california prices will maintain a premium on average to those in the southwest as the effects of the state s tight supply situation translates to higher prices than those in either the southwest or pacific northwest regional gas market drivers under continuing pressure to inject gas into storage in the face of declining supply and increasing gas demand for power generation gas prices at the henry hub are expected to average per mmbtu in july the strong demand for gas for power generation will keep differentials strong in the southern half of the west in the rockies pipeline constraints will keep differentials wide the heightened call on gas demand for power generation driven by the declining hydroelectric generation and increasing power loads is expected to drive demand increases of bcf per day relative to julyandmmcf per day relative to junedemand levels gas demand for power generation is expected to reach a monthly average record level of bcf per day in july see tablesandthese increases will result in declines in western storage injection rates and in exports from the west both permian and san juan supplies will be pulled increasingly toward the west coast during july low storage inventories and needed increases in injections are driving north american gas pricing the west is the one us region actually running a storage surplus but the recent heat waves and associated pull on gas supplies have eroded that surplus particularly in california see tablegiven the expected increases in gas demand the western surplus should continue its decline this decline and very high demand will reinforce the volatility in differentials already evident this summer california because of the early hot weather in the west and strong gas demand for power generation topock prices have been extremely high and volatile so far this month topock has averaged over per mmbtu above the henry hub flows on el paso and transwestern into california increased by overmillion cubic feet mmcf per day during june relative to may averages and flows are expected to continue to climb by an additionalmmcf per day during july pgt continues to run near capacity see tableat the same time the storage levels within california look likely to fall below last year s levels sometime during the month this intense demand pressurecalifornia demand should increase by nearlymmcf per day in july relative to junewill keep utilization rates on import pipelines high and sustain topock differentials cera expects the topock to henry hub differential to average per mmbtu during july see tablethis high differential will likely persist through the summer with differentials rising above per mmbtu during west coast heat waves southwest san juan price differentials have been volatile narrowing during periods of very high western demand however a very high utilization rate on pipeline capacity into california has widened the topocksan juan differential and that wide gap is expected to persist on average san juan differentials to the henry hub are expected to narrow from current levels as southwestern demand increases with western temperatures demand in the southwest is expected to climb from bcf per day in june to bcf per day in july this increased call on regional supplies and an expected strengthening in permian prices should result in an average san juan differential to the henry hub of per mmbtu in the permian basin prices are expected to strengthen as texas power demand climbs combined with the pull on supplies from the west permian differentials should narrow from their current levels of per mmbtu to below per mmbtu pacific northwest strong june hydroelectric output has limited the call on gas supplies in the pacific northwest so far this summer but as hydroelectric output decreases in june and july gas demand will increase dramatically cera expects an increase of nearlymmcf per day during july relative to june levels the limited demand so far has meant differentials between malin and the henry hub of as much as per mmbtu and topock to malin differentials of over per mmbtu the malin to henry hub differential has narrowed slightly to around per mmbtu it should continue to strengthen with growth in regional demand and average per mmbtu during july rocky mountains regional gas supply within the rocky mountains continues to increase bolstered by continuing growth in the powder river basin this april exports out of the rockies reached bcf per day a record high although there is excess pipeline capacity out of the region into the southwest on the transcolorado and northwest pipelines high utilization rates have widened rockies differentials with the rest of the west in particular rockies to san juan differentials have averaged nearly per mmbtu for june after pricing close to parity earlier in the year that gap should persist through the summer as gasfired generation climbs across the rest of the west demand is expected to average the same level in july as in june in the rocky mountains where coal limits gas s gains in power generation cera expects prices within the rockies to gather some support from increasing power loads in the pacific northwest as well as from stronger differentials in the san juan basin on average rockies differentials to the henry hub are expected to average per mmbtu during july in response to the increasing supplies flowing out of the powder river basin and the increasing pipeline capacity utilization on export pipelines trailblazer has announced an open season for two possible options to extend and expand themile pipeline from wyoming into nebraska although timing and volumes have yet to be announced the additional capacity could prevent serious bottlenecks from developing out of the
