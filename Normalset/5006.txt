 can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculatedi am getting mixed information i know that we use the higher of the two volumes receipts vs deliveries the question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume last month march we left the volume at the nom of day in the past we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume for april the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to day james armstrong is using the actual volume the deal for the fee ismy other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes receipts deliveries and transport should the transport volume be in the calculationalso mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume do i include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nomif you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee i would like to have a copy you can fax it toif none of this makes sense give me a call and i can try and explain further thanks megan
