 The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the power port calc The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the message below is not resolved we have had this problem for about four months now Due to business reasons we calculated the east power books on Monday Enron holiday We received all of the required data to calc by AM and should have been completely done by However the calc crashed six times and finally completed on the seventh try We were able to leave by The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders by the start of the next business day This could have a financial impact on our company Once again I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution of this problem Furthermore it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing business that is using that server Per discussion with Kevin Presto the agreement made regarding EES s use of EnPower was there would be no expense or degradation to ENA s business process I think they need to move to another server Please call to discuss when this will be resolved Thank You Kristin AlbrechtForwarded by Kristin Albrecht HOU ECT onAM Enron North America Corp From Kristin AlbrechtAM To Beth Perlman HOU ECT ECT Randy Matson Corp Enron ENRON Jarod Jenson HOU ECT ECT Christine Nguyen HOU ECT ECT Zhiyong Wei HOU ECT ECT Ravi Ramachandran HOU ECT ECT Stacey W White HOU ECT ECT Jenny Latham HOU ECT ECT cc Subject athena vs quark With regards to the message below we must have athena server to run our nightly risk books for the power group We run one of our three east power calcs on this machine the second largest one Since an acceptable solution for the big power calc has not been provided to us athena CANNOT be taken away from us The east power calc crashedout ofdays last week We usually start calcing at about The calc time is now running at hours and we have about hours worth of work after the calc s successful completion So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building when the calc crashes at Furthermore the West power calc has crashedout ofnights weekly for the lastweeks This is not acceptable We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our system is not stable I feel like we have been very patient at the expense of many late nights I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden today about these problems I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted with the finger pointing between different IT groups Thanks Kristin Albrecht Forwarded by Kristin Albrecht HOU ECT onAM Christine NguyenPM To Ravi Ramachandran HOU ECT ECT cc Randy Matson Corp Enron ENRON Subject athena vs quark Ravi Please advise your users that athena will be completely unavailable starting WednesdayMay The production server is quark gb RAMxprocs quark is configured to our standard for your use Thanks Christine
