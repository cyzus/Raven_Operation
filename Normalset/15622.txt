 hi martina trena i made a few minor changes to the models i reckon these models can be checked in houston nowthe raw data is included see attached spreadsheets and all the regression parameters and main statistics are displayed i became interested in how far dzcv and pllu should be below rpi and whether this model is reflecting any reversion to the rpi level; i believe that the forecasts are accurately reflecting this please see graphs belowboth models really need our rpi curve to be linked at the moment i have just copied the number forward because the autoregressive error term is not very important we can run the models forward with reasonable confidence as i mentioned i don t think we can really run this model more thanmonths in fact i think we should run formonths and blend the nextmonths out with the longterm model hope i can fix the longterm ones now with some new insight regards anjam x plludzcv
