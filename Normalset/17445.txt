 naveen the analytical var approach is working for equity portfolio it gives us the tool to examine the tails behavior for this portfolio and calculate expected tail loss the same should be done for commodities portfolio as well meanwhile as we discussed we can give some rough estimates of the losses corresponding to percentiles other than th look at the figure below you can see var numbers for and calculated withsimulationsthousand simulations ;analytical var gammadelta positions representationandare very close because there are not many options in equity portfoliosimulationssimulations to calculatevar then in order to approximately estimate var forand i scaledvar with factors corresponding to normal distribution for examplenorminv norminv for the result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good justdifferent from the correct number we probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio until we have proper methods implemented tanya tamarchenkopm towenyao jia hou ect debbie r brackett hou ect ect ccvince j kaminski hou ect ect subjectreanalytical var implementation in risktrac debbie i am forwarding to you apage document describing implementation of analytical var in risktrac here is why this effort is very important we need to calculate var for other percentile but or even as mentioned by rick buy and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations;we need to present additional risk measures such as mean tail loss to the board the analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested already so there will be no problems with the algorithm itself we need to get together and discuss it implementation what do you thinktanya
