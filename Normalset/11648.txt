 we had an issue with a psco schedule at fcfor hecraig sold psco mw at thebus it was not specified which bus it was to be delivered to there was a tag put out and it was made by us and has psco listed as the pse on the transmission from thebus to thebus it was denied so that does not mean much i had a lengthy discussion with psco on this aroundam on the th turret you will want to listen to the whole conversation since we take several different directions throughout theconversation bert also had a prior discussion with them aboutminutes earlier on turret craig should have done the deal between am andam i finally got psco to take responsibility for the schedule in a second discussion atam they are supposed to put in a transmission request after the fact for hethey claimed on the last phone call that craigdid not say until further and they will not accept responsibility for he he is supposed to pull tapes and get back to me but of course i have no faith in psco and am writing this now since i m sure you will hear on the tapes the guy knows that he is wrong and wants to cover it up and hope settlements doesn t get after him thanks ryan
