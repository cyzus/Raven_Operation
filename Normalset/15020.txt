 steve i submitted my evaluation general impression was rather negativehe seems to be a consultant type person who speaks about everything with confidence but is short on depth and technical details he is personable outspoken organizedon the positive side also the red flag is that he jumps from job to jobtypical aftermonths when any organization can ascertain his usefulness vince fromstephen stock enron enronxgate onpm tovince j kaminski hou ect ect ccsubjectinterview hi vince what did you think of david hsumy thoughts overall a good guy personable intelligent he could communicate reasonably well but seemed to be capable of losing objectivity in favour of technical advancement he didn t seem comfortable with taking a manmanagement role at least he didn t want to be an administrator he appeared to know a lot about risk in fact jay web called me to say he felt david was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull regards steve
