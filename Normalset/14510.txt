notice hanging on its head maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a protest payment of rscrore disputed amount towards march bill of rs crore to dabhol we were ready with the payment on

resolution forum of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members mseb sources said last week dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept protest payments anymore cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the purported protest or reservation mseb had paid a rs crore february bill in protest last month on aprillast both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government pti business standard friday april enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enronpromoted dabhol power company dpc at its meeting in london on wednesday authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice however this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises a state government source told business standard from london he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue the hardening ofthe board s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc s lenders whohad warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders who have an exposure of aboutbillion in the project sources said given the lenders strong opposition to termination of the contract the enron board s enabling resolution did not have much significance beyondconveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination

is held by mseb through a special purposevehicle maharashtra power development corporation the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party the idbi representative protested against the board s decision the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of billsafter mseb failed to pay rscrore towards the decemberbill dpc invoked the state government s guarantee and then the union government s counter guarantee when payment of the rs crore january bill became overdue dpc again invoked the state government s guarantee mseb retaliated on january by slapping a rs crore penalty for nonsupply of electricity at adequate levels it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting a state government official said the centre also supported mseb s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on the financial express friday april foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc sanjay jog raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pullout lenders to the dabhol power company dpc are a sharply divided lot international lenders in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led bythe the industrial develoment bank of india idbi are categorical that additional assistance to dpc s phaseii will be held in abeyance despite thecompletion ofper cent of the project work the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra stateelectricity board mseb within the next four weeks this follows the authorisation given to enron india s managing director k wade cline and dpc president ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice and transfer notices to mseb following wednesday s dpc board meeting in london the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board isemotions do not work contractual obligations and payments have to be met we are convinced that the mseb has failed tomeet its obligations there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it the structuring of dpc s debt has created two classes of lenders in phasei international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phaseii no lender is however all lenders have a parri passu charge making attachment of assets a messy affairsources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phaseii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no securityother than assets like a sovereign cover it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to per cent from per cent a leading foreign banker pointed out three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders werea there are contractual obligations b mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power while local lenders led by idbiwith mseb parroting the samewere of the view that the current situation is a temporary one international lenderswere steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form the points of contention area that phasei of dpcis backed by a sovereign guarantee b phaseii is not and c to the extentthat phaseii is covered by assets cancellation of phaseii may see all assetseven those under phaseigetting attached therefore an examination on the segregation of assets under phasei and phaseii is now warranted pti addsin a significant move dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rscrore on the centre a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday the indian express friday april enrondabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company a subsidiary of houstonbased enron corphas decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board mseb that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagarbased project in a board meeting held in london on wednesday the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india s managing director k wade cline to serve a preliminary termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year mseb owes dabhol powermillion for power delivered in december and january the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rscrore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed but mseb has paidmillion for february and a payment ofmillion was made for march on thursday thebillion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes while a preliminarytermination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially leadto the abandonment of the project by enron analysts have described the decision as a procedural move consistent with dpc s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb after the company issues the preliminary termination notice step two wouldbe an official termination notice and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project if the project is terminated the government of india will have to take a hit ofmillion besides paying bills of rs crore for the next one year to enron as penaltyour centre s liability if dabhol power project is terminated would be one year s electricity bill and a termination fee ofmillion power secretary a k basu said contractually the centre will have to pay oneyear s electricity bill totalling at present prices about rscrore and take over dpc s debt which stands at aroundmillion if the project was terminated basu said in delhi dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of themegawatt powerplant project which isper cent through while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the companyto get out of the project indian lenders led by idbi are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice during the meeting in london mseb which holds aper cent stake in the project had strongly opposed dpc s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikarboth directors on the dpc boardand the state principal secretary energy vm lal an invitee to the board raised the issue at the board meeting in london mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly threatening to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation in recent weeks dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtraa step typicallyinvoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war coup or a similar radical political event in this case dpc s move was viewed asa threat to stop providing electricity dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power critics object to the company charging rs a kilowatthour for its power compared with around rs a kilowatthour charged by other suppliers the hindu friday april offer of renegotiation too late enron by mahesh vijapurkarmumbai aprilthe enronsponsored dabhol power company which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ppa with the maharashtra state electricity board has decided to keep a stiff upper lip this in turn has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent while in reality a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu ``it is not sudden death of the project and in all probability the dpc vexed with the developments including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option ``this would only eventually come into effect it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved apparently the dpc intends to do some armtwisting at the board of directors meeting in london which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ``too late it also said itdid not see any room for optimism about the outcome it did not however rule out the option of talks thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon the maharashtra chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh had hoped that dpc would not take any ``harsh step which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay in fact the mandate of the team that went on thestrength of its stake in the dpc was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation echo in lsthe enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power ministermr suresh prabhu said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs crores whose liability in the project agreement was limitedthe centre s liability in case of termination is one year s electricity bill and a termination fee ofmillion blow to fisthe termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions fis which under the leadership of the idbi were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice the exposure ofindian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guaranteeeither of the centre or the state the times of india fridayaprilenron ready to pull out but lenders say waitthe dabhol power company board which met on wednesday in london authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board the company however may not pull out of the project yet considering its lenders who met on monday opposed such a move andfavoured renegotiations sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue domesticfinancial institutions led by the industrial development bank of india prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move enron needs the lenders consent to file a pretermination notice for pulling out from the project the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms institutions are yet to disburse aboutper cent of the sanctioned package which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project ``theboard has given powers to wade cline to issue a pretermination notice but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious renegotiation proceedings said mseb chairman vinay bansal who attended the board meeting ``mseb presentedtheir views to the board members and it was understood by enron which alsoincluded the rscrore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings ``we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enronis quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable bansal added ``they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plansin that direction said a top banker who was present during the lenders meet ``there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance he added the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank credit suisse first boston abnamro citibank and the state bank of india where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials however some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimumper cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings meanwhile in a clear reversal of roles maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa ``we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us including dpc deshmukh said deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu s sentiments who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row he however added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the billion project would be a blow to india s efforts to woo foreign investors the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and threearbitration notices on the state government over nonpayment of dues amounting to rscrore and interest towards the bills due for decemberand januarymeanwhile mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rscrore was paid on thursday as protest payment despite the dispute over the amount when asked on the future course of action bansal said it was up to the dpcthe hindu businessline friday april dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination noticethe board of directors of dabhol power company dpc has authorised the managing director mr neil mcgregor to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ppa with the maharashtra state electricityboard mseb ``at an appropriate time the decision was taken at a boardmeeting held in london yesterday ``while mseb which is an `interested party was not allowed to vote it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter a senior state government official said the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one idbi voted against the decision the official said the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a sixmonth ``suspension period according to clause of the termination procedure of the ppa``following the giving of a preliminary termination notice the parties shall consult for a period of six months or such longer period as they may agree as to what step shall be taken with a view tomitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all thecircumstances idbi and state bank of india the principal indian lenders had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination noticefor some more time at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent however domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned midway according to institutional sources indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation mr vilasrao deshmukh chief minister of maharashtra yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated mr yashwant sinha union finance minister is also understood to be of the same opinion ``the dpc will now have to decide what is the `appropriate time to serve the notice the officialsaid mseb pays rscroremeanwhile mseb has paid dpc rscrore towards its marchbill mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid `in protest today morning ``they dpc had billed us for an amount of rs crore we do not agree with some of the items included a senior mseb official said the pioneer friday april enron testing maharashtra s nerves t n raghunatha dabhol power company dpc has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board mseb the maharashtra state government and thecentre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them if the dpc board of directors decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication the dpc board in its meeting in london on wednesday empowered the companymanagement to sever its power supply agreement with mseb a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs crore on the centre the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of interested party when contacted the company s mumbaibased spokesperson mr jimmy mogal declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london we will express our views after a few days he said however maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board s decision as unfortunate we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision mr deshmukh said in mumbai official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay through its tough posture the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for renegotiations with the mseb the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board the sources said that the dpc s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not meanthat the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb if anything the dpc s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb the centre and the state government the sources said not surprisingly the dpc s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government sdecision to set up a highlevel committee comprising representatives of the mseb the centre and the state government to renegotiate with the enrons subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board meanwhile amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head the mseb on thursday made a protest payment of the rscrore disputed amount towards march bill of rs crore to dpc riday aprilthe telegraph friday april enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversyridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board mseb the meeting of the company of which the houstonbased energy giant holdsper cent and the msebper cent was attended by state energy secretaryv m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination the centre s liability if enron decides to snap the agreement will be a year s power bill and a termination fee ofmillion however the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug the centre shrugged off the move saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit power minister suresh prabhu said mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings the decision coincided with a rs crore protest payment by thecashstrapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs crore there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron s hub in houston and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head mseb officials brushed away the allusions saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the statewide bandh we have a disputed payment of rs crore which will be taken up at the disputeresolution forum a board official said last week dpc toldthe state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position mseb officials say bechtel and general electric the other partners who hold aroundper cent in dpc are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre s and state s counterguarantees unlike those made by international lenders maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron s decision unfortunate we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties the statesman friday april enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director mr k wade cline to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of thebillion power project the decision which could lead to the cessation of dabhol s power supply to the state was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board mr vinay bansal while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president mr sharad pawar and union power minister mr suresh prabhu who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh and an mseb delegation last monday the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counterguarantee further the dpc has already slapped a notice of politicalforce majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the eventof exigencies that force it to take an extreme step the union power minister mr suresh prabhu contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only per cent of the total energy output of the country its termination wouldnot have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation however if terminations proceedings go through enron corp aper cent shareholder in the dabhol power company would stand to net a hefty amountin damages the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs crore which is the total of one years electricity bill and a termination fee ofmillion according to an energy analyst mr pradyumna kaul the total liability would notcross rscrore however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that thethat scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs crore it islearnt that onapril mr deshmukh had given the goahead to the mseb toprepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpcs board of directors on wednesday at the meeting the energy minister padamsinh patil energy secretary mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal were also present the notice was prepared over the past weekendand taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu onapril however the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough given its huge stake in the project and that such a notice would not be necessary the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariffwith enron s consent among those present at the london meeting were mr lal mr bansal and mseb technical director mr p paunikar in their capacity as directors however they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board it is learnt the chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh said the state was not in favour of terminating the project this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to armtwist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the pastthree months cleared the mseb owes enron rs crore for marchand rscrore for decemberand januarythe centre today put up abrave face on enron s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country pti reported from new delhi there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector in fact not only the power ministerbut also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector mid day dpc may not wind up maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor managing director of the dabhol power corporation dpc has been given complete powers with regard to dpc s operations in the state including theauthority to wind up operations it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday ranganathan said that state officials including maharashtra state electricity board mseb chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal have reported back to him about the meeting in london with regard to the state s failure to pay enron ranganathan said bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ppa and dpc owes some money to us our people informed enron officials about this in fact there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice in thelondon meeting mseb and industrial development bank of india idbi representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rscrore since it could not supply power whenever needed chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enronpromoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to windup operations deshmukh added we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision deshmukh had earlier said we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state as it would be harmful to both of us enron officials are keeping mum on the issue mcgregor said i am not going to give any comment mid day april enron offers no comment on renegotiation h s rao a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company dpc promoted by the us energy major enron was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its million power project in maharashtra but there was no official word on the indian and state governments decision to renegotiate the contract an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting saying the issues discussed at the meeting were confidential we have not received any direct communication unless we get it and evaluate the details we have no comments to make the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on renegotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board mseb hasper cent stake asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company s stake in dpc maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company he said the maharashtra government is not in favour of terminating the mw project but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio mid day friday april committee to renegotiate enron deal a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow at the most he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra stateelectricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee we don t want to take any hasty decision deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite states willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee chief minister saidit was unfortunate earlier in his meeting with hazare deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people he also gave apatient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various statedepartments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months afternoon april enron s on state govt to renegotiate dabhol power project by hubert vazthe us power giant enron power corporation s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise though the dabhol power company chief mr wade cline has been authorised to doso since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter disclosing this chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued and at the same time enron did not feel slighted enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision weare waiting for their letter he said when asked what sort of compromisethe state government plans to forge mr deshmukh said let our officers come back after that we will decide a future course of action but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron s decision but as of now the project is still on when asked whether the project could be moved to another state if wound up from maharashtra mr deshmukh said that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government however it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself he indicated he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated the board of directors of the dabhol power company which met in london on wednesday decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project if he deemed it fit however this decision as of now does not necessarilyindicate the death knell for the project the enron project which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time the previous senabjp government which had been out to terminate the project however chose to continue with it following renegotiationswith enron s top visiting officials like ms rebecca mark and the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago meanwhile state energy minister dr padamsinh patil when
