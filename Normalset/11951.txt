the reverse is equally true in negotiation this technique is called active listening the crucial element is listening closely to all the elements of the responses to those questions both the questions one asks oneself and the questions asked of other people it is no less important to respond to what people say by checking to make sure you ve understood their points; you may want to say this is what i understood you to have said; is my understanding correctyou also want to indicate the fact that i understand what you have said does not necessarily mean i agree with you clinging on to the visual indicators of independence is a critical vital sign the fear of loving relatives that something bad can happen has to be balanced against the knowledge that if you kick someone in their selfesteem you are attacking a most vulnerable part of their anatomy you cannot negotiate away a person s selfesteem but you can destroy it through frontal and flanking attacks the frustration faced by folks who see loved ones failing to take proper care of themselves is phenomenal very often the people who have advocated professional care ultimately must mutter hopefully to themselves the unsatisfying statement i told you so in your question you indicate that crisis forces choice perhaps the best approach is to prepare a safety net that is ready when the crisis occurs it cannot prevent a crisis from happening; and it is crucial to make sure that a crisis is not worsened by forcing the victim of it to lose face but having that safety net ready can at least reduce the force of the fall relationship is one of the seven most significant issues to consider in negotiation focusing on the relationship with an elderly parent or friend not letting decrepitude get in the way of love and caring can make it much easier when someone s selfesteem is attacked by a crisis looking at oneself and saying it s not my fault is not a way of avoiding blame but rather giving a loved one the freedom to make their own mistakesjust as they did the first time they gave us the keys to the car tnsc news the negotiation skills company s website www negotiationskills com is now getting more than million hits a yearthat means an average of more thanvisits every day there have been newspaper and magazine articles about us across north americaand we re now featured in translation in a web magazine in poland last word don t look back somebody may be gaining on you baseball star satchel paige take care steve the negotiation skills company fighting fires without burning bridges phonefaxhttpwww negotiationskills com
