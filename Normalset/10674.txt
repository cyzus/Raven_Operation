 distributed powerthe next big investmentwith today s electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available supply and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent results distributed power just may be the next big thing according to bear stearns analyst robert winters with technologyladen electricityhungry companies popping up every time you turn around and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large power grids are becoming less reliable the analyst points towards distributed energy services as a possible solution and maybe the next big investment opportunity for the coming decade in winterspage report distributed energy servicesthe world s power and transportation industriesset for a revolutionparthe examines technologies and companies within the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage of the current situation thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation a wave of new investment in the power industry has just begun we believe that this coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of at t in the earlys said winters companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of high quality reliable power added winters according to his research microturbines are the best positioned of the new technologies that would be able to have an immediate impact on electric generation he based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small quiet efficient and very versatile they can be used as a main power source a backup power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in traditional energy prices the analyst said microturbines can also be used in remote locations including developing countries that do not have access to electricity another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel requirements the units often use natural gas but can also use several other fuels as well in the study the analyst also examined fuel cells flywheel technology and existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and stirling engines which he noted are enjoying a comeback in addition to the report winters initiated coverage on two distributed energy companies he labeled active power a company that is pioneering flywheel technology as a buy and capstone turbine corp a leading manufacturer of microturbines as attractive the companies are in addition to two fuel cell companies he currently follows ballard power is currently a buy and plug power is rated neutral
