 bizarre as it sounds we ve now heard that they are calling the assembly members back so it appears that the assembly leadership will at least make a run at this we are getting more information and mobilizing industry some key considerationsthe governor is putting immense pressure on the legislature to get something done the legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the governor for having done nothing becauase the assembly has thus far done nothing the only thing it has in front of it isthe assembly could not agree to the speaker s bill because it felt the bill was too far to the left; butis even more onesided so there s a reasonable likelihood thatwould have to be amended considerably in order to get the support necessary to get voted out once voted out of the assembly it would have to go back to the senate where the senate would have to approve it again the senate has adjourned so burton would have to round them up and call them back for a vote and there s no indication at this time that burton s inclined to come back in addition burton has said that he s not interested in making any changes tothat it sor nothing consequently for the sentate i e burton to vote it out it would first have to agree to the assembly s amendments thus far the assembly and the senate have not seen eye to eye on the issues all that said this legislature is far from rational and nothing can be counted out we re therefore operating under the assumption thatcould move will report back as information becomes available best jeff scott govenarsgovenar govadv com pm please respond to sgovenar toban sharmaban sharma enron comdavid leboedavid leboe enron comeric letkeeletke enron comjennifer thomejennifer thome enron comken smithken kdscommunications combev hansenbhansen lhom comhedy govenarhgovenar govadv commiyung bustermiyung buster enron comjanel guerrerojanel guerrero enron comrobert frankrfrank enron commike daymday gmssr comleslie lawnerleslie lawner enron comharry kingerski enron comharry kingerski enron comkaren dennekdenne enron comsteven keansteven j kean enron comalan comnesacomnes enron comsusan j marasmara enron compaul kaufmanpaul kaufman enron comjeff dasovichjdasovic enron comjim steffesjames d steffes enron comrick shapirorshapiro enron comccsubjectassembly sessionurgent the assembly is tentatively scheduled to take up sbxin committee on friday if the bill passes it may go straight to the assembly floor that night the senate may go in either late friday or early monday to take up the bill as amended although this has not been confirmed amendments to sbxmay be available tomorrow
