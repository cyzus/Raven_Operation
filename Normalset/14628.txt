sixth of its peak needs over time the hunger for power will only grow india cannot afford to waitfor the painful politics of seb reform to work themselves out the governmentshould bring in legislation that allows ipps to sell power directly to payingcustomers this will free ipps from the clutches of bankrupt monopsony buyers the power trading legislation will have unexpectedly happy consequences
