 eia predicts supply shortfall will linger through winter the energy information administration said yesterday in its september shortterm energy outlook it is projecting natural gas prices at the wellhead will increase by aboutthis winter octobermarch compared to last winter residential prices for gas are expected to rise on average bycompared to last year for the entire year the average wellhead price for natural gas is projected to be mcf the highest annual wellhead price on record in inflationadjusted terms it would be the highest annual average price sincethe shortterm supply constraints that are currently hindering the industry s ability to meet storage and power generation demand at the same time are likely to continue into the heating season eia said storage levels could end up being aboutbelow the fiveyear average of about bcf by the start of winter if net injections continue atbelow historically average rates through the remainder of the refill season the effects of increased drilling for gas are not expected to appear in the form of significantly increased production until after the next heating season according to the agency s report for now we are continuing to maintain a conservative view of possible increases in domestic gas production forandwith assumed increases of andrespectively for this year and next the eia report stated on the other hand the u s natural gas rig count on augwas at a recent high ofrigs exploration and production budgets for many natural gas producers are expected to increase sharply inandspurred by higher prices and greatly improved current and expected revenues from producing assets also on the positive side data from the texas railroad commission suggest that through may yeargas production increased if only slightly this signifies a turnaround however modest in a key producing region very high gas drilling rates including a recordsetting pace in deep offshore gulf of mexico confirm that increasingly positive results for domestic gas production are under way imports are projected to rise by aboutnext year primarily because of the bcf d alliance pipeline coming on line next month meanwhile the demand outlook remains bullish at annual growth inhowever the forecast has been revised downward to growth because of higher than expected natural gas prices the industrial sector is the leading sector for demand increases inat while electric utility demand is expected to decline by primarily because of power plant sales for the power generation sector as a whole gas demand is expected to grow this year and ineia said the reduced growth rate next year is largely due to the reversal in relative prices of fuel oil and natural gas which began in august with fuel oil gaining the price advantage as gas prices continued to rise gas demand this winter is expected to be up by compared to last winter if weather is normal normal weather implies arise in heating degreedays compared with last winter
