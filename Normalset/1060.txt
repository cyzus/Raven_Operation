 I agree with the exception of pointbelow I plan for them to be one of several authorisers of bills in no case however the only authorisers Also I spoke to Sally about the agency office and she agrees that in the short term the agency plan is what we need to implement However a mentioned by both Ted and Sally we need to discuss what the ultimate goal is for these offices will they continue to existLet s call what we plan to implement now Phase I Best regards ToRichard Sage LON ECT ECT ccSally Beck HOU ECT ECT Brent A Price HOU ECT ECT Fernley Dyson LON ECT ECT Mike Jordan LON ECT ECT Shona Wilson NA Enron Enron Ted Murphy HOU ECT ECT Naomi Connell LON ECT ECT SubjectReTrading v Origination Offices ThanksI think this is a good start as far as roles go but as I outlined to Shona last week we should apply some basic rules to the process forgive me if obvious for exampleRule No confirmations issued chased or matched by remote offices This should be done centrally and further all the customers of the remote office should be given contact numbers e g fax at the operations hub That way any incoming confirmations etc go to the independent ops group Rule No cash payments or receipts in respect of transactions approved or reconciled by remote offices Operations hubs should reconcile cash movements to changes in position Rule No physical settlements or receipts in respect of transactions approved or reconciled by remote offices This splits the logistics process somewhat but is essentially as with cash in that every movement of physical product should be approved where necessary and reconciled to movements in the position at operations hubs The initiation optimisation aspect of logistics could remain remote since arguably it involves pseudotrading Not exhaustive but helpful I hope DP Richard Sage ECTAM ToSally Beck HOU ECT ECT Brent A Price HOU ECT ECT ccFernley Dyson LON ECT ECT Mike Jordan LON ECT ECT Shona Wilson NA Enron Enron Ted Murphy HOU ECT ECT David Port Market Risk Corp Enron ENRON Naomi Connell LON ECT ECT SubjectTrading v Origination Offices Sally Brent There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which previous to the acquisition by Enron acted much as trading offices Shona and Naomi have worked with the people in New York to put in place extra controls so that they are not trading offices for example having a trader in New York or London own each book and sign off on profit daily This process has highlighted the fact that our nontrading offices are not all the same and cannot reasonably all be the same Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground some originate and some execute for Trading Offices is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit All the cc above are bought in to this approach What do you require to be comfortable so that we can put it up to Causey and BuyIt is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki except for the Contractinabottomdrawer but no system of control can reliably catch that as was evidenced by EOTT Thanks Richard
