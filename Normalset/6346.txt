 do you need more from me on how we would structure the jean deal if we did itseems unlikely based on below we will be able to david original message fromredmond brian sentthursday august pm tokitchen louise ccoxley david subjectbridgeline louisei spoke to texaco today and put forth the following alternatives remove randy and put jean in his place i did offer to consider paying randy out of his contracttransfer all texaco enron employees to bridgeline without the ability for them to get paid out and walk away when the texaco chevron merger occurs texaco strongly no violently opposes installing jean as president as they feel that everyone would quitand no doubt many would my counter was that many of these people may quit anyway once the texaco merger occurs so we are in the same spot but with a president that is committed to the company my personal feeling is that we would also loose a number of the enron folks but we could recover and may be better off i m not sure we have a legal case to force randy out especially given texaco s violent opposition however the threat of jean as president seems to have a good deal of motivational power jack abadie committed to propose the following to texaco in his meeting in nyc next week all employees become bridgeline employees nowtexaco employees get paid by texaco their severance as followshalf when the merger occurs the remainder aftermonthsif texaco employees leave they loose the unpaid severance i am going to develop our legal position to see what leverage we have or don t have i do have the open cost issues as a bargaining chip but would like to drive this to a crisis point before playing that card i have a bet with texaco that i can have the bridgeline benefits plan in place by the end of the month jeannie slone is committed to this goal also i have not yet relayed the texaco conversation with jean and would like to hold off to see how this plays out regards brian
