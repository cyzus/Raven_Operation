 here are a few alternatives to handling lal echterhoff s situation we give cash difference in blackscholes value between one year and three year options calculated as of the termination date ofthe analysis isn t very prettythe total difference for all affected shares is onlythese options are so far in the money that the time value is de minimuswe could have them cancel their old options and purchase on the open market some options with longer terms the lowest strike price available for januaryleaps isand the term still isn t quite long enoughmost affected options have a strike price betweenandthis alternative would need tax accounting and sec research and would cost about mm in totalwe could just purchase januaryleaps with a strike price ofand not ask them to cancel their old optionsthis would cost aobutmm still a problem with term not syncing with their old options but it would give them the opportunity to doubledip in value if the stock ran up between now and may if you would like me to do any further due diligence on any of the three above let me know i still recommend the previously drafted email to lal reiterating that the plan provisions prevail morally it may not be correct but it would take an exorbitant amount of feelgood and money to get any further improvements in our ranking as the best place to work; everyone knows what enron is when they come here and we re very open about it we are efficiently darwinistic not feelgoodanythingyouwant i don t think we should apologize to those who don t read their agreements or plan documents or the fine print the caveats were there i do feel bad that this happened and we should make sure the right people signoff on this sort of thing in the future regards aaron
