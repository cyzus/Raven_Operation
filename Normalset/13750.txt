williams iii bill nonprivileged pst commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference the chief judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that you can take a horse to water but you can t make him drink below is a cliff notes version of the judge s report and recommendation issued at pm today attached is the complete work the judge opined that very large refunds would be due while the amount ofsuch refunds is not billion as claimed by the state of california they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sumat the same time while there are vast sums due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers by the caiso the investor owned utilities and the state of california can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the sellerthe chief judge thinks not another notable quote it is the opinion of the chief judge that the amount claimed by the state of california hasnot and cannot be substantiated the judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on julywhich was summarily rejected by the state of california and that the five separateoffers of the various industry groups to settle with california were also rejected refund effective date refund effective date of october for sales in the spot markets of the caiso and the cal px the chief judge s recommendations do not go beyond that date spot market sales are sales that arehours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery evidentiary hearing the differences between what the state of california believes the buyers in the california markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the california market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact the appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes thus the chief judge recommends that a trialtype evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a day fast track scheduleit is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding however such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the caiso s and cal px s spot markets in an afterthefact refund calculation in any event sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period methodology the chief judge recommends that the methodology set forth in the june th order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the caiso s and cal px s spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period october through may heat rate the actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates associated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the june th order provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit gas cost the gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price in the event that the marginal unit is located in np north of paththe daily spot gas price for pg e citygate and malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal unit s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour if the marginal unit is located in sp south of paththe daily spot gasprice for southern california gas large packages should be multiplied by the marginal unit s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour the daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in financial times energy s gas daily publication for the aforementioned delivery points the last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that gas daily is not published weekends and holidays o m adder an adder ofmwh for o m should also be included with the calculated market clearing price emissions costs demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation credit adder thepercent adder should be included in the market clearing price for all transactions that occurred after january when pg e and socal edison were deemed no longer creditworthy ancillary services consistent with the june th order ancillary serviceprices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the realtime imbalance energy market adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the june th order maximum price for nonemergency hours somewhat unclear the chief judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds the refund methodology should deviate from thenonemergency requirement of the june th order to measure the amount that actual prices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculatedoffsets recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the cal px and caiso to resettle all charges for the refund period amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amountsdue from buyers would be recalculated any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of theirpurchases from the caiso and cal px during the refund period interest interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unlessthe refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller
