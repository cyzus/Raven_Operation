driving the gas market as things stand themarket is headed into the winter exposed to a supply shortfall late in the wintereven under normal weather conditions this prospect has placed a floor on the gas price at the price of residual fuel oil itself priced in the mid to upper s range gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back into the market diverting supplies from storage and increasing supplyconcerns again to the upside there is little demand response to price untilindustrial demand lessens or the price of distillate oil as of this writing nearper million british thermal units mmbtu is breached however distillatemarkets themselves are extremely tight and prices for that fuel would likely followgas prices up within this range prices are defined mainly by supply anxietythe markets judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall which would be characterized by extreme pricing and volatility and a difficult process ofsupply allocation by price by now exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain although cera expects storage injections to increase by approximately billion cubic feet bcf per day from august to september this increase would still leave inventories at record lows for this month and next even this increase in injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore platforms or if hot weather returns for october heating load enters the picture with us supplies running closeto yearearlier levels and imports slightly higher demand priced out of themarket will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from lastyears low level as a result although prices may close the month of september inthe uppers per mmbtu at the high end of the competitive range with residany threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upwardduring the remainder of september or in october as the heating season begins therefore cera expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter to result in the first ever monthly average price of at the henry hub see tableand the first of potentially many months at or above that price gas storagenew record lows cera estimates that storage inventories in the united states crossed intorecord low territory as of the end of august when inventories of bcf fellbelow the previousrecord low of bcf see tablemore records will likely be broken in the coming months and by widening margins injections for september are expected to average bcf per day an increase of bcf per day from the august level but below last years pace of bcf per dayceras september estimate could be exceeded under mild weather conditions with no tropical activity hitting the gulf of mexico but injections wouldlikely fall below the bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation of platforms this rate would leave us inventories at bcf at months end a record low bybcf for october cera expects a slight increase in the injection rate from lastyear injections of bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by demand priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropical storm activity october injections have varied historically from bcf perdayto bcf per dayeven if injections reached toward the upper end of this range the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the winter at the expected injection rate us inventories of bcf at theend of october would result in an end of marchinventory level ofbcf under normal winter weatherbcf below the previous record low ofbcf regional marketswaiting for winter the pipeline explosion on el paso during late august intensified thesubregional pressures already at play in western gas markets cuts in pipeline flowslimited access into california on the only pipeline route into the state with anyexcess capacity the lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and forced strong storage withdrawals in the california market although summer power loads in california will ease and much of the el paso capacity has been restored the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winterheating load will keep intense pressure on topock prices differentials in the restof the west will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply to ease pipeline bottlenecks see tabledifferentials in the east which have traded in a narrow range this summer will likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season inoctober however exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later thisyear ceras outlook by region followsrockies pipeline bottlenecks out of the rocky mountains this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb during october cera expects that as local demand limits pressure on pipeline capacity differentials will narrow october differentials should average per mmbtu san juan the resumption of flows on el pasos southern system combined with production outages has relieved some of the access constraints on san juan supply seasonal declines in rockies to southwest flows and the beginning of the heating season should narrow october differentials to per mmbtu permian and midcontinent the continuing pull on supplies from the west will support permian prices and the midwestern pull on supplies will support midcontinent prices cera expects a differential to the henry hub of per mmbtu for midcontinent supplies and per mmbtu for permian supplies chicago the delay in the inservice date for alliance from octoberto octoberwill take some gas out of the chicago market next month this delay combined with the need to build midwest storage inventories should sustain the recent increase in differentials from therange to above per mmbtu cera expects october differentials at the chicago citygate to average northeast markets gas prices near have increased the fuel cost of delivery from the gulf coast into the northeast raising the floor level for differentials to near per mmbtu the beginning of the heating season and the lack of new capacity into the new york citygate should support differentials above the floor during october at near per mmbtu canadian marketsoutages affect supply outages have affected supply thus far in september both british columbia and alberta have been affected resulting in a further
