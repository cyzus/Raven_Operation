 louise with regards to the tibco compatability issue if you dont want to wait for the windowsmigration in mid may it appears that migrating to tibco in nt requires running a migration script that takes abouttominutes but there is a risk that there would be some interruption if the migration doesn t go to plan we could go for this friday and the infrastructure team are already working on modifying a version of the migration script to work on windows nt in anticipation another option would be ask the windowsmigration team to switch their rollout schedule around to pick up the singledeal entry users earlier please let me know if you are prepared to wait for the windowsrollout regards steve
