whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition means that i have to capture meanreversion via the futures volatility function and jumps are less easy to calibrate any suggestions regards bernard original message fromvince j kaminski enron com [mailto vince j kaminski enron com] sent marchtomurphy bernard ccshirley crenshaw enron com;
