crisis remains unresolved and blackouts in california have gone from threat to reality the western gas and power markets grow increasingly distorted by the perceived risk of selling energy to californias two largest utilities normal power plant operations and power pricingdynamics have been supplanted with federal mandates to deliver power to california and power basis differentials are being influenced by credit risk regional hydroelectric supplies have been drawn down at abnormally rapid rates to meet current demand such that in the absence of increased precipitation throughout the west suppliers will be unable to depend heavily on hydroelectric outputin february and later in the year gas suppliers are growing increasingly wary about shouldering the increased risk natural gas and power prices have declined from decembers record levelsdriven in part by januarytodate weather that has been warmer than normal although topock gas prices remain above theper million british thermal units mmbtu level basis differentials to the henry hub have declined dramatically from a premium over henry hub prices ofper mmbtu in december to an average of per mmbtu in january demand levels will likely hold near january levels during february as the already intense pull of gas for power generation continues because storage levels in california remain lowthe california citygates will be exposed to temporary price spikes during spells of cold weather differentials for february are expected to average to per mmbtu in the rocky mountains and san juan producing basins during february per mmbtu at aeco and per mmbtu at topock power prices in january have followed both the decline in gas prices and the shift to warmer weather however there is growing unease in the power markets with the dry precipitation season to date a significantly lowerthanaverage hydroelectric season would permeate through the power markets for all ofplacing gasfired generation on the margin virtually the entire year cera has incorporated a lowerthataverage view of hydroelectric generation into itsgas and power analyses february onpeak power prices are expected to average per megawatthour

see tableconcerns over low precipitation levels and the high drawdown rate of pacific northwest hydroelectric facilities leave the pacific northwest particularly vulnerable to higher prices in february as winter weatherdriven demandspikes challenge regional supplies and california demand prevents a significant level of exports from california to the pacific northwest even under normal hydroelectric conditions demand growth in earlywas expected to push the utilization rates of us western systems coordinating council wscc gasfired generation facilities topercent well above the

utilization rates to nearlypercent in the first quarterthis will cause markets to clear at or above the production cost of gasfired generation even more often thaninpacific northwest hydroelectric

megawatts mw of capacity was nearpercent of the historical average as of early january and reflects the general condition of the major reservoirs in the region in the event that precipitation remains low the drawdown of these facilities in early winter to meet load spikes in the pacific northwest and california has hurt the regions ability to supply power throughoutand will maintain upward pressure on power prices aboveaverage temperatures in early january have helped to mask some of the underlying strong fundamentals in the pacific northwest strong demand growth for the first quarter nearpercent is expected however owing to economic growth and a return to normal weather from last years mild winter see tablelow hydroelectric availability and persistent gas prices in thetoper mmbtu range at sumas have the potential during the remainder of the winter to cause price spikes well above theper mwh onpeak levels so far in january although average prices should be much lower decembers average ofper mwh demonstrated this potential clearly see tablealong with demand growth near percent yearoveryear in february cold snaps will again bring price runups particularly in the event that persistent low precipitation in the region reduces the ability of hydroelectric operators to draw down facilities past alreadylow levels cera expects midcolumbia prices to stay near january levels in

ious continue to struggleto obtain gas and power supplies in the face of financial insolvency california power prices have reflected a premium associated with the higher risk of supplying the state january differentials with western prices have grown as high asper mwh owing in part to temporary supply shortages as nuclearand other thermal plant outages at times have totaled over mw northern californias import constraints make it particularly susceptible to these temporary shortages suggesting that continued low hydroelectric supplies will increase the risk of repeated localized blackouts in the event of extensive future outages the agreements reached through negotiations between suppliers the ious and state and federal officials in recent weeks will calm some of the price inflating uncertainty in the market but california will be the premium market through the first quarter ofand most of the coming year owing to persistent supply tightness for february in california cera expects sustained price strength ofper mwh on peak andper mwh off peak rockies and the southwest the southwest and rockies regions had warm weather in december and the first half of january but have not been completely insulated from the price runups in other parts of the west demand growth in the region is expected to be nearpercent for the first quarter with february experiencing moderatepercent growth suggesting that most of the price strength will be attributed to interconnections with the hydrodeprived california and pacific northwest markets capacity margins in the southwest are at their highest levels during the winter andas an isolated subregionwould exceedpercent at this time compared with california prices prices in the southwest and rockies regions will reflect the relatively low cost of gas supply and the prevalence of coal fired generation mw orpercent of the installed base in the region ceras outlook for onpeak average price for february ispermwh offpeak prices in the rockies will drop nearlyper mwh below the southwest reflecting the ability of california markets to exert moreinfluence on the southwest than on the rockies western gas markets although gas prices at topock have come down from lofty december levels winter is far from over in the west; indeed the pressure is intensifying the credit crisis precipitated by the power market crisis is spilling over into gas markets; storage levels within california are again at critically low levels the mild weather during december and early january allowed some improvementin the positions but when pg es suppliers began refusing to serve becauseofthe utilitys credit problems the utility responded by drawing heavily on storage inventories and a spell of wintry weather compounded increased demand in the face of limited supplies as a result overall inventory levels are again falling quickly cera estimates that inventory levels in california are approximately billion cubic feet bcf a continued heavy draw on gas for power generation will keep demand levels high see tableand the inability to manage demand spikesby drawing on storage inventories leaves the market exposed to price spikes normal weather during february would probably allow prices at both topock and malin to settle back into the to premium to the henry hub but extreme weather could push basis differentials as high as per mmbtu in the rockies and san juan basins differentials will depend critically onthe weather because supply levels and storage inventories in the rockies are healthy the impact of swings in regional demand can cause wide swings in differentials cera expects the swings to continue through february with differentials generally maintaining wider discounts to the henry hub by theend of the month as high absolute gas prices continue more and more effects of these prices will emerge cera estimates thatmmcf per day of base industrial demandin the westparticularly in californiahas switched off of gas some endusers have turned to diesel fuel for industrial boilers; some plants have simply curtailed operations in response to the higher prices on the power side plants within california are extremely limited in their ability to burn alternative fuels because of emissions credits however plants outside of california do have some backup capability arizona public service has purchased barrels ofsulfur residual fuel oil to burn as an alternative to gas given the intense pressure on gas oil will absorb someof growth in power loads california in november an early strong draw on storage in california raised questions about winter deliverability within the state a combination of low storage inventories high gas demand for power generation and continued high utilization rates on import pipelines into the state will keep pressure on california prices through february see tabledespite efforts by end users to limit gas burns in the state in the face of extremely high gas prices cera expects demand during january in the state is up bymmcf per day on ayear overyear basis in february loads should start to decline as residential and commercial demand declines through the month however power loads will remain strong and actually climb from january into february as hydroelectric generation falls this demand support continued strong capacity utilization rates in import pipelines into california and critically low storage inventories will keep intense pressure on gas prices within the state through february during periods of high demand prices will likely reach back up into the to per mmbtu range eventually as heating loads settle and storage draws slow toward the end of february differentials should ease back into theto per mmbtu range on balance cera expects a topock differential for february of per mmbtu see tablepacific northwest three factors have combined to strengthen malin prices over the past week and these forces should extend price strength at malin into february first the return of colder winter weather after moderate temperatures during late december and early january is increasing heating loads and power loads second lowerthannormal hydroelectric generation is increasing the draw on gas for power generation during a season when the pull is normally low third the california power shortage is drawing on all regional supplies and supporting the demand for gas for power generation pacific northwest demand is expected to hold flat relative to january levels during february with slight increases in gas demand for power generation offsetting declines in residential and commercial demand the sustained high demand levelsdespite relatively healthy northwest storage inventory levelswill keep malin prices well above henry hub prices cera expects a malin to henry hub differential of per mmbtu during february a dropoff in demand ofmmcf per day is expected in march as steep declines in heating loads offset continued increases in gas demand for power generation however prices at malin will likely remain unusually strong this spring part of the shortfall in hydroelectric generation continues to bemadeup by draining reservoirs that early drawdown will limit the availability of hydroelectric generation through the spring and early summer months both low hydroelectric generation and a challenging storage refill season in northern california should sustain the malin premium to the henry hub even into the spring rocky mountains the volatility in rocky mountain differentials continues differentials continue to depend primarily on local heating loads; cooler weather supports loads and prices within the region but periods of warm weather drive steep declines in rocky mountain prices relative to prices at the henry hub during february demand should drop off in the region although declines in heating loads in neighboring western regions will be offset by increases in gas demand for power generation the rockies remain primarily coal based as a result the lower expected hydroelectric output will do little to support loads within the region increases in supplycera expects supply increases ofmmcf per day duringrelative to will overwhelm available pipeline capacity out of the region demand during february in the rockies is expected to remain flat at bcfper day; however within the month demand loads will drop substantially this will put pressure on differentials toward the end of the month and cera expects average basis differentials to the henry hub during february of per mmbtu that widening trend should continue during march with differentialsto the henry hub eventually reaching per mmbtu this summer southwest prices in the san juan basin have been following rocky mountain prices up and down with regional demand loads that dynamic will likely continue through february cera expects relatively flat demand during february within the southwest as in the west as a whole a significant dropoff is expectedduring march as residential and commercial heating demand wanes for february continued strong demand loads within the rockies and southwest will support prices in the san juan barring unusually warm weather cera expects a differential to the henry hub of per mmbtu as residential and commercial loads decline sharply during late february and march prices in the san juan will reflect ample supply cera expects declines in san juan production duringbut declines will be limited by the strongest drilling activity for conventional supplies in the basin in adecade however pressure on rocky mountain supplies will mean increased exports from the north into the san juan and those increased exports will more than offset the declines in local production pipeline capacity constraints out of the san juan will again mean wide san juantohenry hub differentials with pressureon prices developing during the spring and intensifying through the summermonths western canadaincreasing supply aeco differentials to the henry hub have ranged between per mmbtu and over per mmbtu given strong demand in the united states export pipelines have been running near capacity all winter even the bcf per day alliance pipeline has been running full; through the end of the winter continued strong us demand should keep export pipeline flows near capacity given these flow levels cera expects differentials to remain near theto per mmbtu level reflecting the cost of transport on transcanada the only available export capacity out of alberta for february cera expects a differential between aeco and the henry hub of per mmbtu storage inventories in western canada are running below historical average levels but the refill season should be manageable; inventories are nowhere near as low as us inventory levels inventories in the west are expected to fall slightly below historical average levels by the end of withdrawal season and exports should decline relative to first quarter levels as injectionseason begins in the spring cera expects differentials to henry hub prices to narrow sometime in the late spring as the focus in alberta turns from filling us winter demand to refilling
