 Everyone This is what CGI forwarded me this morning with regards to a potential partnering agreement with Enron to respond to the RFP sent out for development of BackOffice systems The idea is for us to license our sourcecode for the mid backoffice technology to CGI who will then tweak it to build a system for their customers At this point in time we have not made any commitments whatsoever and are planning to do so only if this can be done with minimal handholding from us given our other project commitments Please read through the Teaming Agreement at your earliest so we can all discuss any revisions you may want made As CGI will be responding to this RFP today with potential support from ENW i e our code would be one of the key selling points they had requested some basic information on Enron which we provided to them late last week This will be bundled with company specific information for CGI that will be provided as part of the Response to RFP Beth I ve also left a message for you with Blanca Lets talk when you get a chance so we can discuss this and other things sometime today Regards RahilOriginal Message FromGreg Feltongregory felton cgiusa com ENRON [mailto IMCEANOTES Greg Felton Cgregory Efelton cgiusa Ecom E ENRON ENRON com] SentTuesday March AM ToJafry Rahil SubjectTeaming Agreement Rahil I ve attached a copy of the teaming agreement Steve and I worked through Please note his final comments which are acceptable to us Thanks Gregory P Felton Director eBusiness Solutions CGINorth Loop West SuiteHouston TXOfficex MobileeMailgregory felton cgiusa com Original Message FromAbbanat Stephen [mailto Stephen Abbanat ENRON com] SentFriday March AM Togregory felton cgiusa com SubjectRETeam Meeting Greg Two quick comments Mutual nonsolicitation agreement will not be accepted by Enron It is corporate policy not to enter into these agreements because they are unenforceable internally we are just too large and recruit too many people to track them Certainly we will not use the partnership to recruit your people but can not commit to that in writing Second the term of the confidentiality agreement is quite longyears In the high tech world this is considered a quite long I think our attorneys like to keep these shorter again for tracking purposes If we can make ityears and remove the mutual nonsolicitation I will forward itSteveTeaming Agreement doc
