 hi vince amitava and i have received a request to build a nonfirm power curve for each region from david hoog s double trigger folks the objective as they explain it is to allow the desk to buy nonfirm from the market buy david s outage product and sell firm to the market accountants would like a curve to mark the nonfirm position my initial thought is that the desk should provide this nonfirm curve but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in david hoog s court to build the curve if david wants to sell his product internally to the desk assuming we build the curve the next issue is how to define nonfirm the only way i can think of is to tie the nonfirmness to a specific generation unit or group of units this will allow the purchase of david s outage product to cover the nonfirmness risk tying the definition of nonfirmness to a whole region seems implausiblewhat does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the regionconsequently the nonfirm curve takes on a unitlevel interpretation and not a regionlevel interpretation consequently i do not see how we can talk about the nonfirm curve for the region we will need to build a nonfirm curve for each generation unit or group of units maybe i could get your thoughts later today thanks vasant
