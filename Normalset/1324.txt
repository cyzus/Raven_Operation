 Sally Dolores Muzzy Celeste Roberts assistant was attempting to schedule a meeting to discuss the Commercial Services program The reason that Dolores is trying to schedule a meeting is follows Celeste and I were scheduled to speak briefly at Rick s staff meeting on Tuesday April th as we had at Cliff Baxter s on March th However we were not going to have a significant amount of time and because the discussion may have been extensive Rick agreed that it made more sense to schedule a meeting in which the Commercial Services program was the sole topic of discussionYou and I had exchanged voice mails on March th immediately after Cliff s staff meeting where you indicated that you had a group of individuals who were involved in recruiting and who would like to meet with us regarding questions about the management of the program You indicated that you would facilitate scheduling the meeting However given that I had not heard from you and Celeste had told Rick we would schedule a meeting it seemed to make sense to combine the meetings since they would most probably include some of the same individuals and cover the same questions I have no problem with you facilitating the scheduling of the meeting as you expressed to Dolores However given that we told Rick that we would schedule a meeting we are just trying to make sure that it does not slip through the cracks We will attempt to be available whenever it is convenient for you and the group that you wish to pull together If you wish to schedule a meeting immediately our availability is as followsFriday April th fromp m Monday April th froma m Tuesday April th froma m or p mp m Wednesday April th froma m If these dates don t work please don t hesitate to suggest others We look forward to meeting with you Thanks Charlene P S My schedule gets pretty crazy so if you could let me know as soon as possible what date works for you I can be sure to hold the time Thanks
