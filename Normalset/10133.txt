 notealliance announced an octoberofficial inservice date for tariff services; however they will be selling test gas in ramp up period right now these first deliveries are going into the anr system because it is the only interconnect that is ready alliance delayed but deliveries begin ramping up after months of speculation in the industry alliance pipeline confirmed yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until octwhen construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago octwas the target date for commercial service however the delay doesn t mean the market won t be getting any canadian gas out of alliance until the end of october the pipeline opened one of its chicago delivery valves last thursday and started sellingmmcf d of gas into the market it intends to increase its sales each week eventually reaching its full bcf d load prior to switching to commercial service on octsaid spokesman jack crawford we got commission approval to actually sell our test gas right now i think we are dealing with three or four different marketers our initial deliveries right now are into the anr system that s because its basically the only connection that is ready but over the next few weeks we expect they will all be ready to go and we will test them all i d be surprised if it ends up being regular [volume increases ofmmcf d each week] but that s kind of the game plan said crawford on octit will be alliance selling [bcf d of] test gas and on octit will be shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other the market may not see much of a difference we obviously don t want to start charging our shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked out the pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of northeastern british columbia and northwestern alberta to the chicago area where the line interconnects with the north american pipeline grid currently more thanof the total pipeline system has been installed includingmainline compressor stationsreceipt points in british columbia and alberta anddelivery points in illinois commissioning activities commenced in march including the flowing of gas into the completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe at present approximatelyof alliance has been purged of air this includes all the mainline portion of the system miles from near gordondale alberta to the delivery section near joliet illinois andofmile laterals receipt portion of the system additionallyreceipt point meter stations have been commissioned final commissioning activities are also being completed atmainline compressor stations to datebcf of gas is in the commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system with the ultimate line pack targeted atbcf crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed startup the rain in saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in july but we managed to catch up on the construction there in august but it then meant that some of our commissioning didn t get going until a little bit later farther west in alberta and bc in fact we ve had a couple of rain problems in particular we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we haven t even been able to get on the right of way yet and that s because of rain up in bc we ve been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on one of our laterals up there he said we re likely to get approval to opencut that creek but that will take us probably the better part of a month on the downstream end we had hoped to get more of our downstream connections right now we are testing one but some of the others aren t quite ready yet we re ready but they are not then of course there is a fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the [aux sable liquids] plant we haven t had a chance to work on that yet so when you look at all of those things the question was when could we establish a date when all this stuff would be done and we would be operational we spent a fair amount of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction we agreed we would pick one of three dates all mondaysoctoctor octand we just had to pick one that we felt confident in besides the timing of service there has been another important question on the minds of many market observers will the gas alliance ships come octbe incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through transcanada i don t think it s going to be purely either way said crawford lots of guys are targeting for novto bring their new gas on to start the gas year so it all depends on how much shows up it s not a big secret that we ve had some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasn t gotten done that s likely to have some affect on it as well that s a delay though how long are people going to payfor gasboy people are going to have a lot of money for drilling and projects
