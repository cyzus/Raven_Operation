 tw and caithness met in denver this week for the first facetoface meeting between the parties the purpose of the meeting was to review the status of the caithness big sandy project and to establish the next steps for moving the project forward caithness corporation caithness corp is a privately held company based in new york with a variety of business interests the company is essentially a financial vehicle for private investors their energy segment currently owns mw of generation through renewable assets in california geothermal at coso wind in tehachapi and palm springs and a gas fired plant in south carolina jointlyowned by florida power light big sandy project the big sandy project is a proposed power plant to be located near wickieup arizona the project would be built in two phases first phase would bemw with a gas load of approx mmbtu d and phasewould add anothermw for a total ofmw with a gas load of mmbtu d the proposed location of the plant is approximatelymiles south of transwestern s pipeline the takeoff point on transwestern would be at near valve station approximatelymiles downstream of compressor station the current estimate includes an alignment that follows arizona state highwaysouth to a locationmiles southeast of wickieup in the s wof sectiontn rw mohave county arizona there is akv transmission line owned by wapa that crosses the property this line is one of the principal electric transmission systems in the southwest and extends from the phoenix area to the mead substation near boulder city nv i ve included a wapa map below which indicates this line also on the site is a water pipeline owned by the cyprus amax bagdad mine water for the plant will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells they have currently dug the first two test wells each capable ofcfm the power plant will require approximately cfm of water in addition to the wells the plant has several thousandacre feet of water rights to surface water from the big sandy river the project may also purchase water from the cyprus bagdad water pipeline the chief geological feature of this area is the big sandy river and associated wash the highwayroadbed follows along the river the area includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain with some limited agricultural and ranching interests wickieup is a very small town with an estimated population

julycommercial operation novemberthere are two lead agencies for purposes of the project s eis the bureau of land management blm kingman office and the western area power administration wapa there is only one endangered threatened species known to be present in the area lateral pipeline alignment the most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline the alignment lateral pipeline route must be included in the eis to be filed next month caithness has spoken preliminarily with the arizona department of transportation adot and the agency is amenable to granting an easement for the pipeline the problem appears to be in the limited amount of right of way available measured from the shoulder to the fenceline there is only aft right of way available for construction typically pipelines require aft temporary construction easement andft of permanent right of way preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this alignment may be the roadway s routing within the wash of the riverbed if the highwaycorridor is unsuitable for the pipeline the second alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent n s section line the problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site the routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas possibly necessitating deep burial and anchoring the other route would involve following along the wapa electric transmission corridor the only issue there aside from whether wapa would permit the pipeline encroachment is whether there are safety and or corrosion concerns associated with a high pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system other preliminary project issues there are other fundamental issues to address the original concept was to interconnect the proposed transwestern lateral with el paso s northern mainline and the yettobeconstructed questar southern trails pipeline both of which lay adjacent to transwestern s mainline transwestern s original estimate to construct alateral pipeline and meter stationmm was based on the following specifications mmcf dpsig delivery pressurepsig inlet pressure the meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a higherpsig minimum delivery pressure new technology westinghouse turbines in addition our understanding is that epng s system operates at a pressurepsig lower than transwestern s in order to accommodate epng deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure the design will likely change to apipeline next steps responsible party department task date due party dept
