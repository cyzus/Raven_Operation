williams iii bill nonprivileged pst over the past few weeks the real time desk has had several cuts on schedules that have involved mirant in the southwest i thought that i should bring it to all of your attention that mirant has not been fulfilling their obligation to resupply cut schedules in several instances mirant is also not telling any of the downstream counter parties until after the hour of thecut this evening steve and i had four separate schedules in which mirant was cut by pac transmission for several hours in each of these cases mirant was unwilling to resupply and was unwilling to contact the downstreamcounter parties it appears to me that they don t want to take the time to resupply or are simply not competent enough to fill the schedules on three of these schedules i had to negotiate a book out for mirant and on onei was able to resupply in all of the recent cuts i have dealt with themon they have acted in a similar manner after discussing this issue with cara she thought it would be prudent to pass this information along to allof you if you have any further questions about this issue please feel free to contact me
