 attached is a revised draft of tw s capacity option filing i thought the comments i received last week were very helpful and pursuant to our discussion i ve added language addressing rates limitation of liability and the necessary exception to commission policy some of the language will probably need to be expanded or changed i have also included a section in the tariff crossreferencing applicable general terms and conditions the letter and tariff sheets are redlined; i did not make significant changes to the agreement i have not come up with a projected filing date yet; i believe it is important first to plan our prefiling communication with customers as well as informal discussions with ferc staff i will be contacting some of you to coordinate these efforts and this should help us decide on a reasonable date market servicesbecause this filing is still just a draft and may change based on what we hear from customers i will just continue to keep you in the loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in order to get the information you need please let me know your substantive questions and comments on the attached before next wednesday if possible thank you
