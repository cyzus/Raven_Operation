on el paso s south mainline downstream of pecos river nm station ceased after the pipeline exploded early saturday killingpeople and seriously injuring two others at a nearby campsite el paso said monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume through a combination of fuel switching by downstream customers maximum storage withdrawals an ofo and other customer cooperation the market reaction was rather predictable as all three california points rose by aboutcents to lead an overall price surge however utilities in the state did not appear to be experiencing any supply problems socal gas said storage and supplies from other southwest receipt points were adequate to avoid any problems a gas operations official for los angeles dept of water and power also saw no reason for panic from past similar incidents on southwest pipelines he expected that the approximately feetlong section missing from el paso s line could be slapped back into place rather quickly el paso itself had no estimate for when it can restore service in the impacted segment; it must get approval rom the federal investigators before beginning repairs or evaluating a restart of the adjacent lines but a large aggregator and a marketer agreed with the ladwp official that it should be a quick mechanical fix once repairs begin the aggregator believed downtime could be as short as a week no customers were cut off as a result of the rupture but some were getting reduced volumes an el paso spokeswoman said northern natural gas was seeing a throughput increase ofmmcf d monday while transwestern volumes were upmmcf d as a result of shippers diverting gas away from el paso s south mainline an enron spokeswoman said a producer said she diverted as much of her company s gas as possible from el paso to transwestern people were reluctant to trade permian basin gas monday especially at fixed prices because of doubts about how much would be able to flow several sources said permian numbers rose a little less thancents as part of the general upturn however it was waha prices that saw a bigger increase of nearlycents as a result everything in el pasopermian s keystone pool was going back into waha said a marketer putting waha in the mids at a premium of more than a nickel above henry hub the southern california border at an average of nearly led the rest of monday s market by a large margin before trading began enrononline was offering border swing swaps for the rest of the month at a marketer said with swing swaps priced so high it gave sellers more confidence in what prices they could command in the day market he said either way i wouldn t want to be short right now at the border there were lots of rumors but no facts available on what caused the el paso rupture noted one aggregator but it s a good thing it didn t happen until after california had cooled off otherwise i could easily have seen the border basis spread from san juan basin go as high as instead of the approximate gap of egistered monday by daily gpi a knowledgeable source provided his analyis of the blast the structure of the crater made the rupture look like a line integrity problem from the way it blew out the earth can harbor leaking gas for a while until eventually everything all goes up at once people nearby would not have detected anything because gas is odorless in longhaul lines; the mercaptan odorant is not added until it gets to the local distribution stage pipeline safety surveyors usually will look for dead vegetation in the vicinity to detect a leak but this was a desert area with very little vegetation it is easily possible for escaping gas to hug the ground for the approximate foot distance to the victims campsite and seek an ignition source there it is a normal tendency for gas leaking into the atmosphere to stay close to the ground and that tendency would have been amplied by the chilliness of the predawn desert the source went on to say i think there will be lot more of this [ruptures] in the future with many pipes becoming at leastyears old el paso was unlucky in experiencing one of the early incidents he said because the situation applies to the other lines with old pipe pipelines used to spend a lot more money on maintenance when regulation was tighter and they were still paying for depreciation he said now they re more purely forprofit companies after having written off their [depreciation] costs many times over el paso blast kills ; shuts down south mainline federal and company investigators monday swarmed over the scene of the devastating el paso natural gas mainline explosion that erupted near daybreak saturday engulfing a party of weekend campers along the pecos river near carlsbad nm and killingpeople two other persons were hospitalized in critical condition three officials from the federal office of pipeline safety ops andwith the national transportation safety board ntsb have been at the site of the blast since late saturday and two more ops officials were en route monday new mexico gov gary johnson who flew to the area on sunday said he wanted to know how many other potential pipeline dangers there are in the state he called for a thorough investigation aboutbcf d of capacity on el paso s southern leg initially was lost from the ruptured inch line and two looped lines nearby that were shut in after the accident el paso was making up some of the shortfall by drawing the maximummmcf d from its washington ranch storage field downstream of the accident increased use of other pipelines allocations and cutbacks by customers and the fact that weather had moderated in california helped ease the supply situation nevertheless spot prices increased by aboutcents for points in california while the rest of the market spurred by hurricane debby went up aboutcents there was no estimate as to when the looped lines would be back in service according to el paso spokesperson kim wallace we don t intend to put anything back into service until we know for certain that the remaining pipelines are safe wallace said she did not expect them to be back in service today and could give no time frame on when they would be returned to service it is much too premature at this point to predict when the three disabled el paso westbound lines will return to service said patricia klinger a spokeswoman with the department of transportation s research and special programs administration rspa which oversees the ops the one that ruptured is definitely going to be out of service for awhile and [another line] is badly damaged from the fire as for a third adjacent line that could potentially be reopened but we have to test the integrity of that line and have it examined by metallurgists she told daily gpi everyone will be working of course to try to get this [line] back in service but the safe operation of the pipeline is of premiere importance the three lines shared the same rightofway we re just now able to start looking at exactly what happened and how to get that one line back in service klinger said our metallurgist is on his way right now i know he s going to meet with the ntsb when they re examining the foot section of pipe that s out of the ground as a result of the explosion i think the company also wants to decide what types of tests can be done on this line it s not piggable the ntsb which has set up a command center in carlsbad nm declined to make any preliminary speculation about the cause of the explosion it s much too early for us to even think about the cause of this accident we re only dealing with the facts right now we re documenting the pipe itself and surveying the land we re going to look at the chronology of when the [emergency] calls came in document damage to vehicles and injuries said ntsb spokesman keith holloway probably at this point we re looking at nine months to a year maybe more before the results of the investigation are publicly disclosed holloway noted the rupture occurred at a m mdt in the underground line near the pecos river crossing which is aboutmiles south of the carlsbad caverns national park in a spot popular with local campers and fishermen the blast tore a crater in the earth aboutfeet longfeet wide andfeet deep according to preliminary reports the pipeline was underground at the point of rupture sending two sections of pipe each about feet long flying hundreds of feet the gas then ignited and shot flames from the broken pipe toward sleeping campers the ntsb estimated there was a gap oftofeet between broken ends of the pipeline at the site the fire burned for aboutminutes before el paso workers manually shut off pipeline valves ten members of two families were burned to death in the blast the families who were related by marriage were camping on public land along the river near where the pipeline emerged from the ground to cross the pecos in an aerial crossing alongside a bridge six were pronounced dead at the scene and four others died at texas hospitals saturday night the dead included five children under the age of six including sixmonthold twins two adults were listed in critical condition monday at a hospital in lubbock tx the ruptured pipeline which el paso said was constructed inis one of four that runs along the southern branch of el paso s pipeline system there is an adjacent inch pipeline and another inch pipeline the fourth a inch pipeline was abandoned and is not available for service wallace said el paso and federal officials are particularly interested in the integrity of the second inch pipeline that ran close to the broken line wallace said that none of the company s customers had been cut off of service but they were receiving gas as reduced levels she also said that on auga patrol inspection either done by air or vehicle was conducted on the pipelines located near the pecos river by el paso officials and no problems were found el paso conducted the last corrosion test in february and no problems were found then either visual inspections are conducted on all of the system s pipelines once a month she said and the company follows all federal pipeline requirements for inspections asked whether el paso planned to change its inspection system immediately wallace said that she did not think so but said that if the ntsb review finds something that needs to be changed the company will do whatever needs to be done immediately these situations are so rare she said we don t feel that we need to change what we re doing now but if the situation warrants we certainly will make any changes necessary el paso is working with family members to take care of their immediate needs including hotel accommodations food travel arrangements and medical treatment the company also is providing additional services as needed this is a tragic accident and our heartfelt condolences go out to the families involved said el paso energy president william wise he said the company was working with the ntsb to investigate diligently all matters surrounding this accident and to establish its cause as quickly as possible the fallout of the explosion is expected to extend all across the country as federal legislators consider more stringent pipeline rules following an explosion in bellingham wa that killed three in junelocally carlsbad mayor gary perkowski said that he wanted to find out what happened and keep it from ever happening again that reaction was echoed by the new mexico governor i have a lot of questions said johnson what is the reliability of these pipelines what went wrong was it preventable meanwhile rspa was sifting through its history to determine whether the el paso blast was the biggest pipeline disaster on record in terms of fatalities

one fatality until juneof this year on transmission pipeline incidents which was caused by an outside force eleven people had been injured through june in augustops sent a warning letter to el paso citing it for a number of pipeline safety violations in arizona the ops did not impose a civil fine on el paso but it advised the pipeline that should you not correct the circumstances leading to the violation we will take enforcement actions when and if the continued violation comes to our attention el paso blast may cinch tough pipe safety bill the explosion on el paso natural gas system which killedpeople over the weekend may give congress the added boost to pass a tough pipeline safety reauthorization bill when it returns from recess in september capitol hill insiders said monday this just sadly proves why congress needs to act as soon as it returns [on sept ] to pass the pipeline safety improvement act before any more innocent lives are taken said a spokeswoman for sen john mccain raz in june chairman mccain s senate commerce committee voted out the pipeline safety improvement bill that would among other things give states inspection and oversight authority over interstate pipelines; require interstate pipelines to consult with states about their integrity plans; create stiffer penalties for pipeline safety transgressors; and offer protection to whistleblowers who report pipeline violations mccain proposed the agressive safety bill following the product pipeline explosion in bellingham wa that killed three in junemccain has always been determined to pass this bill this year but this obviously sadly strengthens that resolve she said he will make a determined effort for this to happen but whether it s brought up for a vote on the senate floor will be up to senate leader trent lott rms the mccain spokeswoman said i have no doubts that the senate will push for pipeline safety when it returns said terry boss vice president of environment safety and operations for the interstate natural gas association of america ingaa on the house side a companion to mccain s bill has been introduced as well as a number of other pipeline safety measures but most are at the subcommittee level but the issue could pick up steam in the wake of the el paso blast we must examine why this accident occurred and ensure that it must never happen again said rep joe skeen rnm definitely it s a tragic situation boss said referring to the explosion near carlsbad nm which reportedly left a crater aboutfeet deepfeet wide andfeet long five of thefatalities were children who were spending a weekend camping and fishing with their family along the pecos river the political fallout from the disaster was being assessed in washington d c yesterday any kind of incident has political ramifications we re just not sure how this is going to directly impact pending legislation and regulations boss noted
