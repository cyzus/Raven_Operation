 first off congratulations i hear you now have an adorable baby boy same weight as my nd girllbsoz that s really great louise are you getting any sleephate to hit you with business but someone said you re on email so i thoughti d try we re basically finished reviewing tweaking the business models within ees and it s probably time to see if we can bring closure to the sic code split i m forwarding you a couple of emails to help remind you where we were on this but basically we had general agreement on the sic code split we just needed to agree on the volumetric delineation point for the ena sic codes i had proposedmwmmbtu d and below would fall to ees you had proposed mw mmbtu d and below the majority of ees businesswill fall within the eastern interconnect and my split had more to do with the fact that the ena originators midmarketers were focused onmw andabove after the meetings we just went through with the ees sales groups i would be surprised if many of our customer targets have sitesmw s in the ena sic codes i don t foresee any major issues if we lower the delineation point tomw s would love to get your views soon if possible if you d like me to follow up with john l since you re out i can certainly do so also i ve met withthe industrial market group ray bowen and we ve set up a coordination plan for eim ees to lever the relationships that each organization currently has where the other group may have opportunitiesforwarded by janet r dietrich hou ees onpmdavid w delaineypm to louise kitchen hou ect ect cc john j lavorato corp enron janet r dietrich hou ees eessubject still working on it but here s where we are louise i would like you to reconsider our original proposal for a few reasons i have a lot of history on this one given i ve been on both sides ofthe fence and was the original creator of what ultimately became the eim group as a result i have been in many discussions with lou and jeff on these issues in the original agreement between ees and ena the following sic codes were excluded from ees as part of the minority shareholder agreement in mining except oil and gas ;oil and gas extractiontextile manufacturingpaper manufacturingchemical manufacturingpetroleum and coal products manufacturingplastics and rubber products manufacturingglass manufacturingprimary metal manufacturingfabricated and metals products manufacturingmachinery manufacturingrail transportation all other sic codes fell within ees inwith the buyback of the minority shareholders lou jeff and i agreed to move several of the lower process load sic codes into ees including textile manufacturing like springs industries glass manufacturing like owens corning fabricated and metals product manufacturing like general cable and american national can and machinery manufacturing like lockheed martin this was primarily becausethese customers tend to be of lower energy sophistication and consumption numerous sites in deregulated and regulated environments and of small size the ees value proposition fit these customers much better than wholesale we have completed numerous significant term transactions and outsources in these industries see parenthesis for several for the other sic codes these remained in ena and eim ees has no interest in paper mills smelters fertilizer manufacturers refiners etc we neither have the products or pricing capability to manage or close very largeprocess oriented consumers however there are divisions inside these companies that we have been able to have some success for example the speciality chemicals divisions of the large chemical companies tend to be significantly smaller loads and ignored from a capital dsm and commodity point of view by the large purchasing agents another example is the gasoline retailing networks for the large oil and gas refining companies which can be very small loads spread over thousands of sites another example is the specialty paper container board divisions of the paper companies in several of the large oil and gas and petrochemical companies we have found fertile ground in their office buildings and research centers our proposal to limit ees s activities in the ena sic codes by consumption size was to give us some freedom to target these divisions inside these companies which ena would normally ignore if there is a better way to split this out than by a size definition lets discuss finally given the more targeted and sophisticated sales process utilized in ees by necessity it would be easier to coordinate between the companies based on a size sort where ees had limited access to ena s sic codes versus the opposite on the surface your proposal looks reasonable; however it fails to sufficiently manage the issues for examplehow would you manage a customer like walmart which may use more thanmw at a site but requires a national or regional solution for all sites in both deregulated and regulated jurisdictions; how will we sufficiently manage the ena sales force which tends to overcover and underproduct for the vast majority of these industries and customers ie i think it would be a disaster for ees and ena; and ees has the relationship based selling capability and basic products to successfully manage these customers you could argue right now that is all we have on a final note i believe strongly that john and i should send out a noteto both organizations clarifying these issues because a it is way overdueyears in factit was always difficult when i was upstairs to get lou to cooperate;b it is extremely destructive and unproductive for multiple enron groups to communicate and target the same customer;c i don t believe that the employees on both side of the fence will honor the obligation unless it is expressly stated openly communicated and enforced by the two management teams;and d we need to be proactive because cleaning it up after the dual call etc significantly damages our credibility as enron with a number of these customers it may be worthwhile in the same exercise to let you know what we may be doing in the the utility and generator markets in the interest of open communication and ensure your buyin i look forward to futher discussing this with you our motivations are not to try and enter ena markets but to split the industrial and commercial segments between the two companies clearly which increases productivity and shareholder value regards delaineyforwarded by david w delainey hou ees onpmjanet r dietrichpm to david w delainey hou ees ees cc subject still working on it but here s where we are fyiforwarded by janet r dietrich hou ees onpmlouise kitchen ectpm to janet r dietrich hou ees ees cc subject still working on it but here s where we are janet tried to get through to you but no success so far this afternoon i have removed the split from east to west load power enamw hourly peak demand eesmw hourly peak demand gasena mmbtus day ees mmbtus day i am still working on the codes but the issue is that things like fertilizer companies are not included in the lists so they may cause more confusion tha add value louise
