williams iii bill nonprivileged pst two things weather trackingdid we decide to ask fundamentals about tracking forecastedtoactual temperaturesor would you me to organize this specifically for real time bpa transmission losseswould you prefer that we pay back losses on a daily weekly or monthly basisfor billing purposes and general clarity i think we should keep loss charges separate from actual transmission costs i e pay them back in an annuity each day week or month as opposed to adding them into each reservation chargetoo much room for error also darin presto and casey anderson should both haveaccess to the systems they need; but it seems to be an ongoing process so we ll keep our fingers crossed let me know what your thoughts are on these two things thanks kate
