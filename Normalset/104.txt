 John As of Wednesday we have a resource from Sun Microsystems that is helping us isolate the problems we re having with the UNIX operating system and our code This resource has requested that we bring on an additional application specialist from SUN This has been authorized and the additional resource is scheduled to be on site next week I also have my resources and the UNIX administrators working along side the Sun resources As an aside we are also experiencing performance problems with the gas side of the business I met with Sally Beck s controllers yesterday and we are putting a plan in place The increased trading volumes have seriously impacted our through put and we now have a blitz on to correct the issues These problems have not gone unnoticed I assure you that IT has been very diligent in following through on these problems We re investing heavily in additional hardware bringing in contractors and hiring additional resources at an average ofper week I will keep you posted as we continue to enhance our existing systems Beth John J Lavorato ENRONPM ToBeth Perlman HOU ECT ECT David W Delainey HOU ECT ECT ccSubjectPower Port Calc Issues Beth Please respond with a

HOU ECT ECT SubjectPower Port Calc Issues Guys This Enpower calc issue is a joke How can we be the most Innovative Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem Furthermore how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our power transactions when our back office risk books position management settlements is so unreliable from an IT standpoint In addition we will start losing all of our key people in this area because they are here untilevery night and pm on holidays This whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt with accordingly Please advise Thank youForwarded by Kevin M Presto HOU ECT onPMEnron North America Corp FromKristin AlbrechtAM ToBeth Perlman HOU ECT ECT Randy Matson Corp Enron ENRON Jarod Jenson HOU ECT

Presto HOU ECT ECT Tim Belden HOU ECT ECT SubjectPower Port Calc Issues The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the power port calc The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the message below is not resolved we have had this problem for about four months now Due to business reasons we calculated the east power books on Monday Enron holiday We received all of the required data to calc by AM and should have been completely done by However the calc crashed six times and finally completed on the seventh try We were able to leave by The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders by the start of the next business day This could have a financial impact on our company Once again I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution of this problem Furthermore it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing business that is using that server Per discussion with Kevin Presto the agreement made regarding EES s use of EnPower was there would be no expense or degradation to ENA s business process I think they need to move to another server Please call to discuss when this will be resolved

must have athena server to run our nightly risk books for the power group We run one of our three east power calcs on this machine the second largest one Since an acceptable solution for the big power calc has not been provided to us athena CANNOT be taken away from us The east power calc crashedout ofdays last week We usually start calcing at about The calc time is now running at hours and we have about hours worth of work after the calc s successful completion So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building when the calc crashes at Furthermore the West power calc has crashedout ofnights weekly for the lastweeks This is not acceptable We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our system is not stable I feel like we have been very patient at the expense of many late nights I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden today about these problems I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted with the finger pointing between different IT groups Thanks Kristin AlbrechtForwarded by Kristin Albrecht HOU ECT onAMChristine NguyenPM ToRavi Ramachandran HOU ECT ECT ccRandy Matson Corp Enron ENRON Subjectathena
