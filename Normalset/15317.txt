 network world fusion focusmike jude and nancy meachim on application service providers today s focusfull circleasps the new big blue dear wincenty kaminski today s focusfull circleasps the newbig blue by mike jude and nancy meachim the terms aspand ibmmay have more in common than being three letter acronyms remember big blue of the early sthe vision then was centralized computing mainframe computers hosted complex expensive applications that end users accessed via dumb terminals it infrastructure especially memory was expensive and needed to be controlled with computing resources centralized ibm reasoned they were easier to maintain of course ibm got it wrong in that computers became a cheap commodity and users werent happy simply using dumb terminals they wanted a bigger share in all that technology offered so as memory prices fell so did the idea of central control dumb terminals were transformed into intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data the glass house populated by whitesmocked technicians went out of fashion looking back on those times many of us would shake our heads and wonder how ibm could have been so wrong but maybe big blue wasnt so far off thanks to the advent of application service providers centralized computing is making a comeback asps offer centralized application management the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy but asps now host all kinds of applications including small multilicensed programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand but the principle remains the samecentral control makes support much more efficient and usually cheaper how about that ibmto be fair the dynamics of an asp are very different from old centralized mainframe operations an asp doesnt just host and support an application for general distribution over an inhouse proprietary network unlike the ibm vision an asp is very dependent on network service it is also very sensitive to service levels in the s if the mainframe let you down you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an hour or so and your only recourse was that whitesmocked fellow nowadays users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a minute and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation the world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old s shop however if one could magically transport a computer user from the s to the wonderful new s would it seem all that different to himin an ideal asp world a la scott mcnealys vision users would sit down at a semidumb terminal download the application du jour and start working what did the s user dokind of the same thing so you are probably wondering what is the pointjust thisibms problem was leaving the customer out of the equation and look what happened customers rebelled they didnt buy ibms spiel it became the inthing to hate ibm whybecause the guys in white smocks couldnt spell service and didnt care about customers to be successful asps need to learn from the past they need to tattoo service on the forehead of each of their employees there are too many choices today for customers to put up with inferior service thats one big difference from the s customers now can literally choose any
