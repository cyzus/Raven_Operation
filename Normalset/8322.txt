of springfield missouri; david n cook nerc general counsel; michael kormos pjm interconnection; leroy koppendrayer minnesota public utilities commission; and marty mennes florida power light company general observations the commissioners were all present the majority of the time massey left late in the afternoon ferc staff was active in the discussion; however the commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much asof all questions there was a general consensus that standards were needed;much discussion focused simply on how much and by who the commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible but both they and ferc seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before rtos could really begin to move forward there was discussion on identifying which industry group nerc or gisb would take the reins in the future on an interesting tangential note there was noticeable conflict between nerc and gisb with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions ferc deliverables a great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the commission staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical the first major topic was how many rtoswhat is their scopeall panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by ferc in strong definitive language n o one offered any specific language but seemed to be urging ferc to issue a formal statement the next topic was what will be standard market designpanelists varied on this but most felt strong guidance from ferc is urgent some urged for one mandatory design for north america one supported a set of rigid standard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the current situation the commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward they continually visited this topicthroughout their discussions asking questions like do we need to issue a megaorder that addresses all these issuesand how much detail do youneed us to providegeneral feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas kormos and burkes went so far as to say ferc should mandate as much as they felt comfortableand then go alittle further others seemed to be a little worried about this idea but in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation one item of interestwood referred to the filing made by the electronic scheduling collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the rto design and rto implementation section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to rto design kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry the section to which wood referred was one that i wrote and asked the following questionscongestion managementwhen operational security violations occur how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficientwill lmp based systems be standard or will therebe others that must be accommodatedtransmission serviceare transmission services required to schedule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are allowed loop flowsare contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriateif contractpath based how are parallel path issuesto be addressedgrandfathered transmission serviceshould contracts existing prior to rto development be transferred or is there an equitable way to retire those contractsare there other solutionsenergy imbalance marketshow are imbalance markets to functionwill they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced schedules or will they be required at allancillary serviceswill ancillary service markets be developed in standard wayswill entities be required to actually schedule ancillaryservices required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments protecting against realtime polr charges lossescan we utilize the imbalance markets to support lossescan we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technically unwieldynonjurisdictionalshow are nonjurisdictionals to be integrated into the new worldshould systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an rtoor should they be designed to treat each nje as a separate entityhopefully ferc will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questionspointing out that vague answers i e do congestion management will take a year or two to resolve but specific answers i e lmp with financial hedging instruments will take only months the commission asked mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed now for a funny pointone of the commissioners i think breathitt referred to some concerns expressed in the northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes lmp inefficient for the northwest kormos flat outsaid my profession is understanding how power systems work and i don t believe that that statement is true he then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the northwest interests was false nerc and gisb a great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardsetting organization massey went so far as to ask are we looking at a beauty contest between nerc and gisbcook and boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other s organizations other participants continually reiterated the need for one independent organization interestingly boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in gisb while cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of nerc anddid not focus on its history brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of gisb by pointedly asking both cook and boswell if they lobbied political positions i e werethey not only an organization but also a stakeholdergisb was easily able to say they were not but nerc of course had to admit to their romancing of congress and the bush administration for reliability legislation point brownell mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for nerc playing dave cook s yesman he probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to nerc s supposed successes such as tlr and etag if staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulting in several filings and interventions we may also wish to file commentsin specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to showthe pretty picture marty painted was in fact a fiction there was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issuesbut general consensus was that i could not be done there was also some talk of folding nerc under gisb eisb the arguments began winding down after a some time and boswell strongly urged the commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether nerc or gisb should lead the industry forward nerc somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position in general i wouldsay it was a close fight but gisb came out more on top let me know if you have any questions andy rodriquez regulatory affairsenron corp andy rodriquez enron com
