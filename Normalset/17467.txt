 tanya the exponentials we tried earlier a bexp cx etc fit well butgave negative numbers in the bootstrapping i tried a b t ca standard power law and as theaccompanying graph shows for themonths the fits are quite good in this case the ffvols do not become negative i believe thiscorresponds to yourbeta i would have preferred exp t and variants canexplain owing tomeanreverting vols but the power law might be a practical alternativefrom an implementation standpointnaveen tanyatamarchenko ectpm tonaveen andrews corp enron enron alex huang corp enron enron ccvince j kaminski hou ect ect vasant shanbhogue hou ect ect vladimirgorny hou ect ectsubjectresmoothing methodology for extracting forward forwardvolatilitiesfollowing up on our discussions i implemented one method for creating forwardforward curve from implied vol curvei sorted outforward curves from an original forward vol curve each of curves corresponding to certain month then i fitted each ofcurves with a function y da a power x b betai figured out that when beta is from the above function is suitablefor performing our bootstrapping routine of deriving ff vols from implied because y x t y x t x ty x y x tx for all x ti have to double check on this again also when beta there are somecombinations of parameters a a b beta for which above equality holds even with restriction on beta this class offunctions represents quite a variety of shapesbelow you see the example of fitting as well as theexample of ff vol curveconstructed from implied vol curve for ngi ll try this for power as wellany comments
