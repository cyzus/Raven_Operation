 before i draft a response i wanted to clarify that section of schedule c to the contracting party agreement governing ngx provides for the determination of unsecured credit availability which is essentially a collateral threshold for investment grade counterparties or counterparties that have provided an investment grade guarantee which can be determined in the sole discretion of ngx but with a maximum for bbb credits of cdnmillion the previous maximum for bbb credits was cdnmillion accordingly it is arguable that ngx can apply whatever unsecured credit threshold it chooses however arguably it must do so acting in a commercially reasonable manner and having regard to its equitable treatment of similar graded credits accordingly i will draft a response on this basis imposing an obligation on ngx to treat us reasonably and equitably but in the meantime i believe that we should be taking steps to satisfy ngx s credit requirements both by providing the margin they require and by having the traders minimize their position to the extent possible i will forward a draft response shortly regards peter original message fromkeohane peter sentfriday november am tokitchen louise; bradford william s ccotto randy subjectreremoval of unsecured limits and requesting security i will prepare a response and provide a draft for review bill i will talk to randy about posting and he can coordinate with you or tanya or jay original message fromkitchen louise sentthursday november pm tobradford william s ; keohane peter subjectreremoval of unsecured limits and requesting security i think sorespond rejecting his statements on ene and state we expect fair treatment with other bbb credits meanwhile we ll send the marginour guys should be able to minimize the position louise original message frombradford william s sentthursday november pm tokeohane peter cckitchen louise subjectfwremoval of unsecured limits and requesting security do we need to respondoriginal message fromkenny fookenny foo ngx com enron sentthursday november pm tootto randy; wbradfo ect enron com ccron manitowich; gary gault subjectremoval of unsecured limits and requesting security hi randy bill as per our discussion this afternoon randy enron corp enron has deteriorated further in the market place and the recent downgrade of enron by s p to bbb although not completely a surprise is still disconcerting i applaud enron s effort in obtaining additional bank lines to shore up liquidity but am disappointed that your pipeline assets had to be pledge in support of same additionally moody s and s p have stated publicly that further downgrade is possible i would like to remind you that ngx does not provide any unsecured lines to entities who are rated below bbb as you well know given ngx s size and the fact that ngx needs to keep the integrity of the exchange intact we have no option but to inform you of the following accordingly please be advised that effective immediately enron canada corp ecc will no longer have any unsecured lines here at ngx reference attached contracting party s agreement schedule c para a we respectfully request that ecc provide collateral preferably irrevocable letter of credit else registered interest in cash by the close of business day monday november reference contracting party s agreement schedule c para as i said if some other counterparty was in the position you are in right now you would expect us to do what it takes to keep the exchange safe intact whole at all times please call if you have any questions kenny foo credit and risk manager ngx financial incavenue sw suitecalgary alberta tp n phfxattachment cpa schedule c pdf filecpa schedule c pdf
