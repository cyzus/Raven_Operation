 vince uk var breached the limit last week uk traders asked us to review the correlations across uk gas and power as well as the correlations across efa slots we did part of the work last week now we

lon ect ect subjectrevar correlation scenarios thanks tanya these are interesting results i am on vacation next week so here are my current thoughts i am contactable on my mobile if necessary gas to power correlations i see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting var for the combined gas and power portfolio and this raises an interesting pointat a conservativelong term correlation combined var is omm less than previously expectedso how does this affect the limit breachstrictly speaking we are still over our uk power limit but the limit was set when we were assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio var a suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the uk gas and power books can we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in portfolio varie [reduction portfolio varsum power var gas var ]also if i understand your mail correctly matriximpliesgas power correlation is consistent with our correlation curves and this reduces total var by o mm efa slot correlations the issue of whether our existing efa to efa correlation matrix is correct is a separate issue i don t understand where the matrixefa to efa correlations come from but i am happy for you to run some historical correlations from the forward curves use the firstyears i would suggest our original matrix was based on historicals but the analysis is worth doing again your matrixresults certainly indicate how important these correlations are closing thoughts friday s trading left us longer so i would not expect a limit breach on monday we are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve and i d like to wait until both simon hastings and i are back in the office monday week before finalising this regards

enron enron david port market risk corp enron enron ted murphy hou ect ect ccsubjectrevar correlation scenarios everybody oliver sent us the var number for different correlations for ukpower portfolio separately from ukgas portfolio first if var is calculated accurately the correlation between power and gas curves should not affect var number for power and var number for gas only the aggregate number will be affected the changes you see are due to the fact that we use montecarlo simulation method which accuracy depends on the number of simulations even if we don t change the correlations but use different realizations of random numbers we get slightly different result from the model soto see the effect of using different correlations between gas and power we should look at the aggregate number i calculated weighted correlations based oncurves i got from paul as the weights along the term structure i used the product of price position and volatility for each time bucket for gas and each of efa slots the results are shown belowinserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced negatively definite correlation matrix which brakes var engine correlation matrix for any set of random variables is nonnegative by definition and remains nonnegatively definite if calculated properly based on any historical data here according to our phone discussion we started experimenting with correlations assuming the same correlation for each efa slot and et elec versus gas i am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results in addition to the aggregate var numbers for the runs oliver did you can see the var numbers based on correlation matrixand matrixin matrixthe correlations across efa slots are identical to these in original matrix i obtained this matrix by trial and error matrixis produces by naveen using finger s algorithm it differs from original matrix across efa slots as well as in power versus gas correlations and gives higher var than matrixdoes concludingwe will look at the historical forward prices and try to calculate historical correlations from them tanya oliver gaylardpm torichard lewis lon ect ect james new lon ect ect

violating the matrix s integrity interesting to note that for a higher correlation of the power var increases which is counter to intuition this implies that we need to look into how the correlations are being applied within the model once we can derive single correlations from the term structure is the next action to understand how they are being applied and whether the model captures the p l volatility in the spread option deals from onwards the var calculation failed oliver
