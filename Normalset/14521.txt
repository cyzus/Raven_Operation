sucheta dalal it is finally quit india time for enron though the controversial multinational has denied plans to sell its stake in dabhol power company dpc informed sources say that it has sent feelers to china light power and othersto offload its majority holding getting out of india may be the best course for enron though it has threatened a fight and invoked political force majeure the energy review committee headed by madhav godbole will certainlyweaken its case the committee points out that the many infirmities in the dpc approval process brings into question the propriety of the decisions it is clear that the m that enron spent on educating india s policymakers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of technoeconomic appraisal or due procedure with regard to large international contracts thecommittee says it is troubled with the failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on matters relating to dpc the failure of governance has been broad across different governments at different points of time at both the state and the central level and across different agencies associated with examining the project and at both the administrative and political levels it strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigned responsibilities is purely coincidental though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigatethese infirmities its two key members mr godbole and former secretary in the ministry of finance eas sarma have asked for a judicial inquiry into the process of clearing the dpc project other members felt a judicial inquiry would delay the negotiation process and not serve any purpose there may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiatingtariffs or facilitating enron s exit but the report certainly provides the central vigilance commission cvc with all the grounds that it needs to start an investigation cvc n vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the deal especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign though the political establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry the cvccan establish whether there are lapses on the part of government functionaries including political executives and ensure appropriate action against them if it is indeed able to establish undue influence in signing thecontract then maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently against the public interest without any monetary liability the godbole committee has vindicated the stand of antienron activists who have been opposed it since negotiations began init establishes that enron power is expensive per se and the project needs to be renegotiated regardless of the causes for the maharashtra state electricity board s mseb financial distress also that dpc s extortionate tariffs are not merelybecause of the steep rise in petroproduct prices and rupee depreciation but mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government enron s contract is clearly onesided; it deliberately uses expensive raw material ignoring world bank warnings has worked on fanciful demandsupply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions in fact the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs crore more than it should every year this comprises overcharging of rscrore on account of the large regassification plant of which onlyper cent of the capacity is used for dpc there s also a rscrore extra billing to the mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge by charging more than twice the operations maintenance rate stipulated by the government of india enron collects approximately rscrore extra every year it has also been collecting rscrore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims enron has been charging atkcal kwh under the power purchase agreement ppa although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteedit a much lower consumption rate this gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra the committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiationa rateof rsper dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans rs per dollar as reference rate for phasei rs per dollar asreference rate for phaseii and a curious rsper dollar for calculatinggovernment of india tariff forcing a reduction of these excessive chargeshas nothing to do with contract cancellation all it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment the godbole committee has established that dpc s tariffs can easily be halved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments the takeorpay clause and escrow facility which isin fact hampering mseb s reform particularly in power distribution are scrapped the security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tariffwould be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution systemthe committee also gives enron a difficult escape route it says that if the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous it should free mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside maharashtra the committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by governmentthe public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf and has recommended that all documents including contracts related to all independent power projects ipps particularly dpc should be published by the maharashtra government within two months also having established that demandsupply estimates by the state government were fanciful the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps it recommends that such negotiations should be in accordance with the leastcost plan spelt out by the report this should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance patalganga mittals bhadravati the bses saphale and others to set up ipps in maharashtra the financial express april dpc board set to authorise president enron md to issue notice of termination sanjay jog scrapping of power purchase agreement the board of directors of dabhol power company dpc which has already taken an aggressive posture has proposed to authorise the enron india managing director k wade cline and dpc president and chief executive officer neil mcgregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement ppa and transfer of dabhol project in view of continuing default by the state and central governments and maharashtra state electricity board mseb the board of directors which would meet on aprilin london also plans to appoint mr cline as its true and lawful attorneyinfact and authorisehim to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modifications top sources told the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline and or mr mcgregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and central governments and mseb under clauseand scheduleof the ppa in response to the continuing default by the mseb of its payment obligations under the ppa the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the government of india to honour obligations under its counter guarantee the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings the company resolution said consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clauseand scheduleof the ppa from time to time and at any time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company the resolution added according to the resolution the directors the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually are authorised andempowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution in the name and for and on behalf of the company against this backdrop the state government and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the ppa the state government and mseb sources said that such a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebate penalty of rscrore for misdeclaration and default on the availability ofpower on januaryand februarythe state government and mseb which reviewed its position on saturday at ameeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the termination notice to the dpc the dpc s move to appoint mr k wade cline as its trueand lawful attorneyinfact deserves importance especially when the stategovernment proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficitstates mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in theordinary course in amounts exceeding rscrore or the equivalent in foreign currency in any financial year furthermore mr cline would be in a position to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to the daytoday operation of the company s business or exercise its rights and discharge its obligations

crucial as the dpc board is meeting on aprilin london to discuss the issue of serving a termination notice to the maharshtra state electricity board mseb dpc cannot go ahead with this unless it gets the go ahead from the lenders while bankers said the lenders meeting is about the second phase of the project which is still under construction state government officials clarified that since there is only one ppa covering both phases of the project the lenders decision will be applicable to the existing phase i also the second phase of the project involves mw generation capacity whereas phase i ofmw is already operational according to the loan agreement even if only four per cent of the lenders agree to terminate the contract then dpc can do so highly placed sources in the lenders consortium said from london this in effect means that only one lender has to agree for dpc to serve a preliminary termination notice following the notice there is a cooling off period of six months for both parties the mseb and dpc to find a mutuallyacceptable solution which may take the form of a renegotiated ppa sources added sources also said that there are two separate meetings scheduled with lenders

into the enron deal it could embarrass three governments ranjit bhushan the committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions takenin respect of the enron project at different points of time by successive governments and agencies in the centre and state energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole this could well be the real enron story a fivemember highpowered committee headed by madhav godboleand includingformer union economic affairs secretary e a s sarma hdfc chairman deepakparekh teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government officialvinay mohan lalhas recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron power project deal saying it signified the utter failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decisionmaking processrelating to the dabhol project the report which was submitted to the maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by outlook is severely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar with the congress then the day bjpled union government which reworked the deal inshiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra headed by manohar joshi the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decisionmaking relating to the dabhol project madhav godbole committee report an investigation if ordered could embarrass at least these three governments the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by enronto politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal according to the committee the deal reveals failure of governance both at the centre and state and across different agencies it strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental the report said proposing a set of measures to be implemented if something of the project was to be retrieved godbole and sarma also feltthat the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to order a judicial inquiry this was finally adopted by it says a congress leaderenron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra and put to question liberalisation particularly in the power sector the proposal has already struck panic says ncp s praful patelif the enron decision has at all been detrimental it is because of the haste with which phasewas cleared by the shiv senabjp government now with the statehaving already entered into an agreement with enron the important thing is to resolve it amicably a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it s not an issue of corruption but that of perception promarket congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at thecentre and the state which invited enron even though the second phase wascleared by the bjpshiv sena combine says congress spokesperson jaipal reddyright now we re too involved with the parliament deadlock over tehelka proliberalisation congress mps also fear that such witchhunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors noncongress mps from maharashtra meanwhile claim that the godbole committee was instituted with the express purpose of politicising the enron issue i think i know vilasrao deshmukh s gameplan says an mp from the state but some mps like congress prithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy that s surrounded the dealive maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this the committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected toa technoeconomic appraisal as envisaged under provisions of the electricity supply act ofand related legislations the infirmities could havebeen avoided since this wasn t done questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound toarise the exhaustive page report points out i d highlight the speed with which the day vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit says congress mp prithviraj chavan the enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early s and despite several controversies is now an established power project at dabholkm south of mumbai in julyenron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board mseb to setup a mw station as part of the government s fast track projects subsequently when the shivsenabjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a writ against the project this curiously led to renegotiations with enronthe committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated deal once it gom decided to revive the project it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done it forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency the speed with which the negotiating group studied the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons which was accepted by dabhol is unprecedented says chavani would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the day vajpayee government at centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned since the commissioning of the plant in maythe mseb has paid rs crore for the power it has bought from dabhol if the same watttage of power had been bought from indianbuilt power plants fired by indigenous coalthe payment would have been approximately rscrore in the first yearandahalf of its operation itself the dpc had drained the maharashtra exchequer of nearly rs crore the central electricity authority cea in fact pointed out that the dabhol plant was not the least costly option the mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of kaparkheda but they were in a preliminary stage the report notesif the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects they might not have remained in their preliminary stages it adds that the members were of the opinion that the mseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously based on information available at that time in proceeding with the dpc as a baseload factor even when its capacity was reduced the failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the union power ministry finance ministry and the cea it quotes the cea as saying that since the union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable no further examination was required strangely bal thackeray s shiv sena when it came to power together with the bjp in maharashtra filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal after the new shiv senabjp government took over its cm manohar joshi appointed a renegotiating committee inwhich made the right noises actually managing to reduce the tariff but certain things remained inexplicable no fresh clearances were required from the cea which also said that since no cost increase was involved fresh formal clearance wasn t necessarysays the committeethis only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didn t consider the economic aspects of the project at all indeed given the nonavailability of any official record of the meeting on june with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discussed at all the credibility of the shiv senabjp government has been seriously questioned the committee finds it unexplicable sic why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from million to million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committee the panel observes says lawyer prashant bhushanit is strange that the shiv senabjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coollyrenegotiated the deal the committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid while the mseb was in profit init plunged into huge losses of rscrore insignificantly the world bank inhad predicted the system s inherent weaknesses in a letter written to the then power secretary r vasudevan atop bank official had said that after a detailed review of the analyticalframework and costing assumptions we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the dabhol project as presently formulated is not economically justified and that in our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb system inthe proposed baseload operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch as already existing lower variable cost coal power would bereplaced by the higher cost lng power enron s persistence and the gullibility of the indian side can be gauged from highranking enron official joe sutton s letter to a key indian official ajit nimbalkari recently met with the world bank and have been following the articles in the india papers i feel that the world bank opinion can be changed we ll engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the media from here on the project has solid support from all other agencies in washingtonthe key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at allfor the first time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project according to the report the mseb has been one of the better performing boards in the country and has despite a faulty transmission and distribution t and d system managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis maharashtra accounts for nearly onefourth of the gross value of india s industrial sector it s one of the few states to achieveper cent electrification sincethe mseb has been adding to its generation this improvement which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was being considered the report points out following a policy of crosssubsidy roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasnt been much in fact the subsidy claim decreased from rscrore into rscrore inuntil init increased nearly fivefold to rs crore due to the sudden increase in the gap bypaise per unitfromtopaisean increase ofper cent the increase in the subsidy claim by rs crore is due to the increase in the gap principally because of the increase in power purchase costs says the committeeaddingwithout the dpc and without problems of t and d loss the mseb could be financially healthy but can that happen now since enron is here to staythe committee has comeup with some farreaching recommendationsmake public all dabholrelated documents and agreements restructure the dabhol project itself to bring down the cost of power restructure dpc financially allow sale of dpc power outside maharashtra reexamine ppas in accordance with leastcost plans and thoroughly reform the mseb the committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion the question is can that

disconnections a monthwhich resulted in compliance by consumers with the dabhol power company dpc monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table the mseb has turned to putting its house in order as if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termedas the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record for instance mseb has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended march atunits compared with the previous year sunits makingit the top seb of the country in this respect similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at up from per cent last fiscal plant load factor is up to per cent compared with per cent inthe parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the tenyears of its life time inatmillion units which made it eligible for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the government of india carrying a cash award of rs lakh all other power stations in the state without exception also fulfill the eligibility criteria for the cash award a senior mseb official said similarly the chandrapur power station became the first power station of any state electricity board to get the isocertification a senior mseb official saidearlier mseb was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning the agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals while theft of electricity during the
