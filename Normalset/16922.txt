socal edison misses more payments bush administration opposes price caps but is supporting state efforts to split pg e into separate gas and electricity companies in order to assure continued gas supply absent urgent passage of a bailout plan or an agreement on longerterm contracts utility bankruptcy is still the most likely scenario for further information contact robert johnston x or kristin walsh xlegislation passes shortterm measures sbx passed the california state senate easily as we said yesterday the bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the department of water and resources until february nd the department will havemillion available to finance power purchases but there expectations that these costs could easily rise tobillion by next week abx has evolved into a longerterm solution and in its current form would authorize the department of water and resources to enter into longterm contracts as opposed to theday contracts in sbx to buy power at a price cap of cents per kw h this legislation is not expected to pass today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week period covered by sbx when negotiations between generators the utilities and the state are likely to resumesbx what will the state do with the bond authoritya second piece of legislation currently under consideration sb xhas created uncertainty in the markets this legislation will create a california power and conservation financing authority with bond issuance authority the uncertainty concerns whether the new authority will address the problem of thebillion in outstanding debt owed by the utilities the current text of the legislation focuses only on longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving efficiency yet the legislation also says the authority may issue bonds exercise power of eminent domain and enter into joint power agreements and buy own and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a project the general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of either issuing bonds to finance past debts or using eminent domain or the bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a chproceeding while neither davis nor senate leader burton are talking about a fullbillion bailout at this point the idea of using bond money to pay past debts continues to circulate in the legislature one of the reasons none of the utility creditors have moved to demand repayment is that they are being quietly reassured by the governor s office that there will be a governmentsupported debt workout in the near futurebailout could depend on parents of utilities absorbing losses the big problemand one which have kept the governor nor the utility companies from opting for this solutionis a massive battle over how much of the outstandingbillion in back debt the holding companies of the two utilities will absorb in any restructuring deal as we have reported something like half of that debt is owed by the utilities to their own sister powergenerating companies within their holding company structure the partial deregulation allowed the utilities to split into powergenerating and powerdistributing companies so one side of the holding company buys power from the other sideand public opinion polls show overwhelming majorities understand this quite well davis wants the utility companies to acknowledge the nature of this debt and to absorb some substantial part of the internal debt within their corporate structures; we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or issue bonds to deal with the rest as one very senior california political leader explained getting the utility holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread public outrage about a bailout of private pricegouging companies with taxpayer money sinceof californians currently blame the utilities and the puc for this crisis and onlyblame davis this is a crucial political stance for the governor but of course absorbing anything likebillion in debt would be quite a shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and powergenerating branches of the two utilities and they began spreading the word that they were quite willing to accept bankruptcy thus by midweek both sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court that would be a worst case solution for all sidesthe country s economy would suffer from the resulting credit shock the governor s political future would suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a bankruptcy judge while most private sector legal authorities believe the utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during bankruptcy procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of the debt in the end in addition they would most likely face a state government determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in a major way senator burton s sbx legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically to make this point quite explicit it would set up a california power and conservation financing authority with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent domain it would finance new power plants and consider the feasibility and public interest of the state acquiring operating and maintaining transmission facilities currently owned by investorowned and municipal utilities as we write this all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the bankruptcy ledge to safe ground and there is no question the tone has shifted in the lasthours from macho confrontation to maybe we ve run this thing out as far as we can but as we have noted the chance for miscalculation is still quite high there is no solution agreed to at this time the standoff over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities holding company is continuing and the technical fact of default still makes it possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate accelerated paymentdefault update thursday socal edisonmillion default to california power exchange after edison failed to make a m electricity payment yesterday the california power authority began seizing longterm contacts and reselling them to recoup some of the money owed to generators pg e said it expects its trading privileges at the cal power authority to be suspended today leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources while the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted pg e s and socal s ability to buy power the department of water and resources will be able to pick up some of the slack at least in the very shortterm the state itself may be getting into risky credit territory the proposed california public power authority would borrow in the neighborhood of billion from the state general fund in advance of this year s expected fiscal surplus with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future revenues with nearbankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes it is unclear where the revenues would come from the amount borrowed and terms of repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating agenciesbush policies as we reported on wednesday the bush administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved in the california crisis presidentelect bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root of the current supply shortage bush and his top officials appear to be unanimously opposed to longterm price caps however there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration according to a source close to a top bush economic advisor there is significant concern that pg e s credit problems could cause gas suppliers to stop shipments of gas through pg e s pipeline the risk would be that the pipeline could go dry causing significant and possibly dangerous disruptions in california residences and businesses to prevent this problem bush is working with davis on a proposal to split pg e into separate gas and electric companies the gas company would be solvent but the electric company would go immediately into chfollowing significant defaults
