 brad as we discussed it s very difficult to find drivers of the ene stock s behaviours we investigated aboutcomparable stockscapital market indices and three energy commodity indices regular regressions as well as regressions with different legs and leads were performed some variables show significant correlated with ene stock during particular time periods but most of those correlation disappears when we tested them over different or longer time periods only two variables s p utility index spxu and dow jones utility index util show stable and significant relationship with ene stock a summary of these relationship can be found in the attached file outputsummary but as you can see the r are belowalso thedurbinwatson statistics tell us to be careful about autocorrelationbasically the regression analysis so far confirms our original opinion it s hard if not impossible to find out any real driver of the ene stockafter enron added new core business several month ago the stock behaved moreor less like a tele comm stock which suggests that enron stock has enteredinto a new phase to capture at least trying to capture itscharacteristics in the new phase we need a lit bit more time to cumulate themarket datelet me know if you need me investigate more variables or you come up withsome new thoughtsvincent
