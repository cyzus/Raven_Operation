 our research indicates that inwisvest paid uimillion or approxkw for these two plants with a couple of years depreciationkw as kevin outlined below would still give these guys a bit of a gain don original message frompresto kevin m sentwednesday september pm tomiller don asset mktg ; robinson mitch; davis mark dana; llodra john; broderick paul j cclavorato john; kitchen louise; duran w david subjectconn coal plants as most of you know nrg s proposed purchase of two coal plants in conneticut ui s territory was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at ferc the purchase and sale transaction between wisvest and nrg was originally entered into almost two years ago the proposed purchase price ofmillion formw of coal was a bargain price at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of ct over the pastyears the state of conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they puked the plants to nrg forkw in earlyat a minimum it is expected thatkw of scr and or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the ct regulatory bodies my strong view is that as a practical matter the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in ct the area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire eastern interconnect the load pocket is significantly short mw and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area in a true locational marginal price environment the prices would likely be similar to zone j in new york currently pricing in nepool is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads regardless of who causes the congestion in the recently proposed single ne rto model it is aboutcertain that the pjm locational marginal price market model will be implemented sometime between mid and mid at that point in time consumers in the congested areas of nepool incity boston and ct will be exposed to higher energy prices while consumers in maine new hampshire and rhode island should see lower prices given the facts above coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets i think ews should pursue discussions with wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in nepool and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset node if we could buy these plants for approxkw withkw of environmental upgrades the resulting allin depr fixed variable o m fuel costs nox so capital reserve interest x plant cost would be approxmwh this is lower than our energy only socialized nepool curve additional upside is derived from positive basis icap ancillary services emissions allowances and long term requirements sales to lse s lavo and louisethis could be the alberta ppa forlots of hair but lots of upside any thoughts
