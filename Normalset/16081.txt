 julie the introduction looks fine i have made some cosmetic changes typos and split infinitives that slipped by you can safely ignore most ofthem english is not even my second language the corrections are in pink vince juliejulie lacima co ukon am tovincejkaminskivince j kaminski enron comccsubjectpreface for book vince hope you are well we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book and you kindly offered that you would provide this is this still possiblewerealise that you are extremely busy so chris and les went ahead and wrotesomething which is below and if you want to review change or rewrite thepreface that would be very appreciated let me know what your thoughts are thanks julie we re getting close preface one of our main objectives in writing energy derivativespricing and riskmanagement has been to bring together as many of the various approaches forthe pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible to discussindepth the models and to show how they relate to each other in this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models price a wide range of energy derivatives or to build a risk management system which usesa consistent modelling framework we believe that for practitioners thislast point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles andpresentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and givingarbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using adhoc and inconsistentmodels for different instruments and markets see also others who proposeconsistent modelshowever it is not our wish to concentrate on oneparticular model or models at the exclusion of the others because webelieve that the choice should rest with the user although it will probablybe clear from our discussions the model s we prefer we therefore try andgive as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of allthe models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the modelswhich best suit their needs in order to meet our objectives the book is divided intochapters inchapterwe give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to modeland price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the bookin addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the blackscholesmodelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial treesand monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used throughoutthe book in chapterwe discuss the analysis of spot energy prices as well asanalysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes thatcan be used to model the prices we look at the wellknow process ofgeometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion stochastic volatilityand jump processes discussing each and showing how they can be simulatedand their parameters estimated chapterwritten by vince kaminski grant masson and ronnie chahal ofenron corp discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets this chapter builds on the previous one it examines in detail the methodsmerits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming differentpricing models introduced in chapterexamples from crude gas andelectricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretativeaspects of calculating volatility chapterexamines forward curves in the energy markets although suchcurves are well understood and straightforward in the most financial markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energyprices and the building of forward curves from market instruments we outline the three main approaches which have been applied to buildingforward curves in energy markets; the arbitrage approach the econometricapproach and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochasticfactors chapterpresents an overview of structures found in the energy derivativemarkets and discusses their uses examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps caps floors and collars as well asenergy swaptions compound options asian options barrier options lookbackoptions and ladder options chapterinvestigates single and multifactor models of the energy spotprice and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives closed form solutions for forward prices forward volatilities and european optionprices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all themodels in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenienceyield and interest rate model chaptershows how the prices of path dependent and american style optionscan be evaluated for the models in chaptersimulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to avariety of path dependent options in order to price options whichincorporate early exercise opportunities a trinomial tree scheme isdeveloped this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forwardcurve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european andamerican style options chapterdescribes a methodology for valuing energy options based onmodelling the whole of the market observed forward curve the approachresults in a multifactor model that is able to realistically capture theevolution of a wide range of energy forward curves the user definedvolatility structures can be of an extremely general form closedformsolutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficientmonte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options the chaptercloses with a discussion of the valuation of american style options chapterfocuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with theproblem of managing the risk through time we begin with delta hedging aportfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models thegeneral model presented in chapteris ideally suited to multifactorhedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed chapterexamines the key risk management concept of value at risk var applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products after discussing the concept of the measure we look at how the key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc can be estimated we thencompare the fours major methodologies for computing var; delta deltagamma historical simulation and montecarlo simulation applying each to the sameportfolio of energy options in this chapter we also look at testing thevar estimates for various underlying energy market variables finally in chapterwe review modelling approaches to credit risk welook in detail at two quite different approaches creditmetrics j p morgan and creditrisk credit suisse financial productsfor whichdetailed information is publicly available together these provide anextensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk we presentnumerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in thisbook are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding ofhow both the tooland the market works the techniques we describe arecertainly not magic wandswhich can be waved at data and risk managementproblems to provide instant and perfect solutions to quote from theriskmetrics technical documentno amount of sophisticated analytics willreplace experience and professional judgement in managing risk however the right tools correctly used make the job a lot easier
