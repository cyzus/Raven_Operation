hou ect ect ccmargaret daffin hou ect ect subjectretransition to research groupan update i agree that it makes sense to put the l in place there are several things we will need from you in order to start the visa process the first is a fairly detailed job description for anshuman secondly we also need to know whether or not he will be in a managerial position here and or managing a project if there is someone else in your group who can furnish this job description just let me know and i will be happy to contact him her as for sandeep i have been told that he is a u s resident so there should be no problems with him margaret daffin will be contacting him to be absolutely sure thanks molly vince j kaminskiam tomolly magee hou ect ect ccvince j kaminski hou ect ect subjectretransition to research groupan update molly let s get l for anshuman just in case i am sure he will stay here for a while once he comes it is quite obvious jeff shankman will have to keep him longer given the priority of the project i assume there are no problems with sandeep thanks vince enron north america corp frommolly mageeam tovince j kaminski hou ect ect ccmargaret daffin hou ect ect subjectretransition to research groupan update thank you for the update vince i have been working with margaret daffin with regard to anshuman s visa status we will have to get an l visa in place before he can come to the united states even in a temporary capacity do you want to move forward with that effort at this time or is the possibility of him coming to the u s so remote that it wouldn t be worth the time and money right nowmolly vince j kaminskiam tomolly magee hou ect ect ccvince j kaminski hou ect ect subjecttransition to research groupan update molly this is an update on anshuman please see below it seems that his transfer is not an issue for the time being we can put it on a backburner till he gets here vince p s the relevant section i also spoke about anshuman and there was
