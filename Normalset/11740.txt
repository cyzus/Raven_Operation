williams iii bill nonprivileged pst fired calif dwr traders had access to iso s control room updatedtuesday august pm et by bryan lee of dow jones newswires washington dow jones four of the five california department of water resources power traders fired last month for conflict of interest reasons had access to the state electricity grid operator s control room that revelation was contained in a recent letter to the house government reform committee from terry winter the california independent system operator s president and chief executive the letter responded to house lawmakers concerns voiced during an aughearing about dwr power traders having access to the iso s control room floor and the wealth of marketsensitive information available there rep doug ose rcalif who chairs the committee s energy policy panel said access to the iso s control room allowed dwr traders to cherrypick power purchases and led federal regulators to exclude dwr purchases from consideration in a recent landmark refund order the five fired dwr traders owned stock in calpine corp cpn investments quotessymbol cpnnews investments newssymbol cpnmsgs investments discusssymbol cpna major power

winter listed as having controlroom access neither did elaine griffin who resigned after it was learned she owned calpine stock they were amongdwr employees who had their controlroom access privileges terminated by the iso over the past two months the others had their badges deactivated because they either hadn t filed necessary confidentiality statements or hadn t been using their badges to access the iso control room said stephanie mccorkle an iso spokeswoman nine dwr power traders still enjoy access to the iso control room according to winter s letter to ose among them is bernard barretto who reportedly owns stock in enron corp ene investments quotessymbol enenews investments newssymbol enemsgs investments discusssymbol enesteve maviglio a spokesman for california gov gray davis who recently sold calpine stock after conflictofinterest concerns were raised said earlier this month that barretto s investment met state ethics rules because enron wasn t making sales in the spot market where the dwr employee was involved in making power purchases dwr employees investments are thoroughly reviewed to make sure there are no conflicts dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo said employees must either divest their stock or recuse themselves from deals that involve their financial interests hidalgo said an ose spokesman yier shi said the congressman believes the arrangement has worked against the interests of california consumers it s pretty obvious that it isn t in the interest of california consumers the dwr or the iso to have that conflict of interest in the powerpurchasing process shi said why is dwr getting preferential accessthat s the core issue shi added allowing dwr power traders into the iso control room is a real conflict because dwr is the major buyer in the state said lynne church president of the electric power supply association whose members include many of the companies that own power plants in california having access to the control room gives them intelligence on what sellers into shorterterm markets are charging including what s being sold and to whom church said any kind of buyer or seller would give their eye teeth for that kind of access she said noting that no other grid operator in the country allows that sort of access it s just unconscionable for them to have that kind of access to market intelligence during the aughearing that ose chaired winter agreed that having dwr employees in the control room was a problem the iso is working very hard to get them out he said the access was provided back in january after the dwr was forced to begin purchasing what since then has amounted to aboutbillion in power on behalf of the state s bankrupt and nearbankrupt investorowned utilities pacific gas electric co pcg investments

room effective septpete garris who oversees power purchases for the dwr announced over the weekend it wasn t our intent to be there on a permanent basis said hidalgo the dwr spokesman who described the privilege as a temporary move to keep the lights on now that the state s electricity crisis has lessened the dwr s goal is to have the traders out of the iso control room by septhidalgo said we re pleased to see that the dwr is working toward resolving its conflict of interest problems with the iso said shi the ose aide we hope this change of policy isn t too little too late for california
