 SallyA new idea popped into my headI don t know if it makes things easieror if everyone would like the idea but here goesWhat if we gathered as a whole family for a couple of days somewhere easyin Texaslike the Hill Country Hyatt or somehwere in Galveston or the YO Ranch or somewhere We might spend one night or twoplan something fun for the kids get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad with champagne and appetizersspend time playing games whateverjust go somewhere easyand just spend a day or two Then at that event we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more special and faraway trip for themlike a fourday weekend in San Franciscoor somewhere they d really like to go This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involvedbut provide us all an opporunity albeit condensed to get togetherand Mom and Dad would still get to go someplace fun Maybe we could chip in varying amounts to Mom and Dad s trip so that cindy and richard could afford it ThoughtsCara Cara White Community Development Coordinator USTA Texas SectioncWhite texas usta com
