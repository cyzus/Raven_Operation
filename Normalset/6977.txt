 to alllast night i spoke with trevor milhalik about the cash distribution which would normally occur at the end of the year the most viable and quickest way to get the cash we felt was to increase the revolver frommm tomm because as stated below there exists significant current capital needs to fill the enron storage cavern however even still this would only ensure a cash distribution at the end of decemberthe normal schedule for the partnership there may be one more possiblity we could reapproach the board about the prior structure of levering up bridgeline in order to extract cash from the joint ventureit failed last year because texaco did not want the cash it may different now that chevron is involved but i doubt it my guess is that senior management i e louise would have to put pressure on the appropriate channels i would rather pay a premium to chevron texaco for levering bridgeline than entering in a series of parkandlend arrangements because we could get more cash up front in addition any parkandlend arrangements could have negative earnings impacts contingent upon the shape of the nymex regards jean original message fromredmond brian sentfriday october am tokitchen louise; hodges georganne cccolwell wes; mrha jean; washington deanna subjectrebridgeline cash and ar to allas of today bridgeline has mm of cash and expects to get mm from the payment of oct receivables by the end of the month they have fully drawn down the mm revolver that we put in place earlier this year trevor mihalik bridgeline cfo is preparing a cashflow forecast for bridgeline from now to the end of the year and next year bridgeline s major cash needs are to fund working capital payables and margin calls and to purchase gas that must be used to dewater the storage cavern enron that we contributed to the partnership the dewatering process is now underway and will be completed midmarchat a gas price of and working gas volume ofbcf the total cash need for working gas will be approx mm we are working with bridgeline to find other sources of financing for the working gas that would enable them to make and accelerate thecash distribution to the partners alternatives we are considering to fund the working gasi increase the revolver from mm to mm ii find third parties enron to enter into parkandlend arrangements that would give bridgeline the physical gas they need to dewater the facility without having to pay cash for it most options will require chevron texaco approval which may come at a price i will distribute the cash flow statement when i receive it and jean and i will meet with randy and trevor next week to discuss alternative financing parkandlend arrangements i have been cloaking my questions on the need for cash under the guise of putting together theplan budget headcount capital needs insurance requirements etc we should adhere to this commercial context so that we don t provide leverage to bridgeline and chevron texaco in any commercial discussions i will admit however given the headlines it does not take a genius to figure out we need cash regards brian original message fromkitchen louise sentfriday october am tohodges georganne cccolwell wes; redmond brian subjectrebridgeline cash and ar brian redmond is working this original message fromhodges georganne sentthursday october pm tokitchen louise cccolwell wes subjectfwbridgeline cash and ar importancehigh i am not sure when we received our last cash distribution from bridgeline but will check should we pursueoriginal message fromgruesen karen sentthursday october pm tohodges georganne subjectfwbridgeline cash and ar original message fromschwarzbach emily sentthursday october pm togruesen karen subjectbridgeline cash and ar karen the following are the bridgeline account balances as ofthat you requestedcash ar if you have any further questions or need additional information please let me know thank you emily
