a court will almost always say the agency can fix the energy crisis in any way it deems fit however courts take a dim view of inconsistent agency decisions because it demonstrates a lack of constitutional due process as for the public s opinion of enron as a profiteerfor better or worse it s already established and no matter what action we take davis will cast a negative spin on it so why not fight for our intereststhe stakes in this order are worth it this recent order sets a bad precedent for the future viability of our business model power marketing ; it s hard to run a business when the government can reach back in time and recalculate your selling price with complete disregard of your costs the generators get to offset refunds with input costs we should be able to use our purchased power costs i don t see much downside for us to argue that ferc should keep its word thatrefunds can only be ordered withindays andall sellers are entitled to marginal costs we are just holding the commission to its promise at a minimum the commission needs to explain why it ignored and reversed itself on its earlier holdings these are good questions have a good weekend i copied alan on this because i thought he might be interested in our colloquoy steve original message fromperrino dave sentthursday july pm tohall steve c subjectretwo major inconsistencies in ferc s most recent refund order and the novand decorders steve aside from the fact that the entire play by the ferc in the lastmonths has been purely politically motivated are we going to challenge the latest rulings in courtcan we challenge this apparent lack of consistency memory loss if we were to challenge do you think the general public opinion and impression of enron as a henious profiteer from houston would negate any potential gains made from making such a challengejust curious about what your thoughts planned recommendation are thanks for the information dave fromsteve c hall enron enronxgate onpm cdt toray alvarez na enron enron alan comnes enron enronxgate susan j mara na enron enron james d steffes enron enronxgate richard b sanders enron enronxgate gfergus brobeck com smtp enronxgate christian yoder enron enronxgate dave perrino sf ect ect steve walton enron enronxgate paul kaufman enron enronxgate tim belden enron enronxgate jeff richter enron enronxgate bill williams iii enron enronxgate ccsubjecttwo major inconsistencies in ferc s most recent refund order and the novand decorders the ferc apparently has a very short memory in its dec order ferc clarified that liability for refunds would only last fordays after the transaction was filed with ferc how can ferc now say that transactions from novthrough aprilare subject to refundthe decorder said that only transactions that were identified by commission staff for further review would be subject to continued refund liability otherwise refund potential for transactions overmwh would close afterdays presumably liability for transactions undermwh would close afterdays too here is the excerpt from the decorderwe clarify that unless the commission issues some form of notification to a seller that its transaction is still under review refund potential on a particular transaction will closedays after the initial report is filed with the commission the institution of a day period for the review of the transactions will provide sellers with the certainty they request and allows a reasonable period for analysis by staff decorder at in its novorder ferc said that it would limit refund liability to seller s marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs ferc now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costsmuch less opportunity coststo offset potential refunds from the novorderhowever should we find it necessary to order refunds we will limit refund liability to no lower than the seller s marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs novorder atferc s julyorder makes no attempt to explain its departure from its earlier holdings on refunds in this same proceeding arbitrary and capricious anyonesteve alanplease forward to dan watkiss and ron carroll
