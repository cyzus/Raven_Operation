 ngpl recontracts with nipsco natural gas pipeline company of america ngpl continues to move through the recontracting process like a hot knife through butter since kinder morgan took over ngpl parent kn energy last year the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements and contract extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the midwest including another deal announced yesterday with northern indiana public service nipsco ngpl and nipsco signed a contract extending the terms of several firm transportation agreements totaling mmbtu d of capacity beginning dec and dec and continuing through nov they also extended the terms of two storage agreements totaling bcf of capacity beginning dec and april and continuing through march nipsco a nisource subsidiary is a regulated utility that provides natural gas o nearly customers and electricity to customers across the northern third of indiana virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until the fourth quarter of this year said ngpl president deborah mcdonald in an interview basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the storage contracts are up for renewal every year we ve been very successful in our efforts resigning our three major customers [nigas nipsco and peoples] despite increasing competitive pressure from northern border and alliance pipeline the pipeline also has had surprising luck signing agreements with marketers and power generators in contrast to the traditional market of longhaul transportation from the midcontinent and louisiana to chicago we have been extending our horizons trying to find a new market in the marketers rather than the core ldcs obviously the contract that we signed earlier this year with aquila energy for mmbtu of transportation capacity has also really helped us be successful in our recontracting efforts mcdonald said we also have developed a number of new rate services for gasfired power generators growth in ngpl will come from natural gasfired generation you probably saw our press release about the ameren contracts for [construction of mw of generation along the ngpl system] in the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over mw of gasfired generation this year and over mw next year as well [which would represent up tommcf d in gas transportation capacity] obviously another challenge is going to be [the bcf d] alliance pipeline coming into the market this fall it s anyone s guess whether that will really fill up in a short period of time i think a lot of that will be coming into chicago and moving back out on vector but we re ready at hub america to kind of serve as a giant header system [with texas eastern as an eastbound partner] mcdonald was not prepared however to announce the results of a recent open season for aboutmmcf d of capacity that will be available through a new interconnection between ngpl and tetco for eastbound transportation
