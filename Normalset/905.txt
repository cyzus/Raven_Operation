 See the comment below on Williams confirmation site Sounds similar to what we are proposing on CL One question I m exploring right now is whether we could save more money from an Enron perspective and achieve greater marketability with the model that ConfirmCorp proposes with automated matching vs the Commodity Logic Williams approach that depends on users reviewing approving confirms we ve simply put the current process online so to speak We need to push for a more radical change improvement on a faster timeline I still believe confirms is the correct area to be focusing on as I mentioned in our meeting with Louise but we need to seriously review what we propose to deliver and how Is ConfirmCorp a viable company to bring under the Enron umbrellaI think we should be concerned that late entry with less functionality will erode our ability to sign up customers I don t think each large marketer will want to log in to several sites to clear their confirmations with each of their large counterparties Can we find out if Williams has further plans for their service that would compete with Commodity Logic Forwarded by Mary Solmonson HOU ECT onPMChris Papousekcep confirmcorp comon AM Please respond tocep confirmcorp comTo ron nolte enron comcc mary solmonson enron comSubjectConfirmCorp Info Dear RonI recently sent you information relating to ConfirmCorp via FedEx I trust you have received it by now If you have any questions please do not hesitant to call I will follow up with you in one week Regards Chris Papousek President Confirmation Clearing Corporation PS Williams Energy just came out with Williams CustomerFirst a website that contains all their confirmations While eliminating faxes this puts the onus of verification on the counterparty and assumes there is a confirmation staff on the other end to do the checkout ConfirmCorp will make even this advanced approach obsolete
