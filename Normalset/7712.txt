 hi louise hope all is well and that your trip to and from london went smoothly a few questions does enron have a system which collects data by customerwe have something called cmis which we use for these purposes and which i believe we will need to integrate into the infrastructure if you don t have something already we usually need customer info for reg reporting purposesbob dinerstein believes it would be prudent to have a seminar of sorts whereat the heads of gas and power trading present to key ubsw people what their businesses are all about example trade flows competitive pressures key reg reporting requirements etc he would also anticipate having our outside counsel participate to discuss what they understand to be the developing regulations in these markets the thought is to try and do this on thursday because so many ubsw people will be on the ground in houston for the simulation exercise i don t know that i am wedded to that day and i am a bit unsure about whether this makes sense given it may interfere with progress on integration but this day may work since alot of people will already be there and i am sure the traders will not be interested in doing anything like this once they start trading what do you thinkthe audience would include key logistics personnel from ubsw and enron and anyone else you thought appropriate spoke with mike about it and he is finehaving ubsw paraphenalia sent downtoys shirts etc should be arriving by no later than tuesday if you haven t received anything by late on monday could you let me know so i can track down ubsw and ubsw energy banners are being made to hang from the ceiling on both trading floorsthey should arrive by wedwas thinking perhaps we should have a celebration on the floor on friday to commemorate the closing what do you think i am planning to be down in houston for most of next week i thought it would be helpful to be on site in order to be available to address issues as they arise in order to meet closing on friday i will be leaving on a late monday flight and returning on a late afternoon friday flight i hope you think this will be useful please let me know otherwise sorry for the long message please feel free to call me at home or on my cell if you have any questions issues would like to discuss hccolette visit our website at httpwww ubswarburg com this message contains confidential information and is intended only for the individual named if you are not the named addressee you should not disseminate distribute or copy this email please notify the sender immediately by email if you have received this email by mistake and delete this email from your system email transmission cannot be guaranteed to be secure or errorfree as information could be intercepted corrupted lost destroyed arrive late or incomplete or contain viruses the sender therefore does not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contents of this message which arise as a result of email transmission if verification is required please request a hardcopy version this message is provided for informational purposes and should not be construed as a solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities or related financial instruments
