 louise we have been prepaying the positions to some of our customers some of them have been selling swaps to get rid financially of the pemex fixed price contract and then repurchasing the swaps in some cases they are asking to get prepaid so we call treasury and calculate the npv with the discoutn rate they give us usually enron s cost of funds however i have been able to increase the discount rate in various cases so that we offer a better alternative to the customer than their own cost of funds it has worked and i think we can increase our margins by keep on doing that questionscan we get credit for the origination on top of enron s treasury rate if so with whom should i speak to get it granted to edem best regards
