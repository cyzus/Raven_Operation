 samer s suggestion makes a lot of sense we can start with something like one floating dev licenseopl licenses and buy more later based on actual usage on the pricing agreement it probably makes sense to get a guarantee on the discounts for additional licenses for one year or till dec i am definitely interested and can provide the share of funding necessary from my clients thanks krishna fromsamer takriti enron communications onam toravi thuraisingham enron communications enron communications ccchonawee supatgiat corp enron enron pinnamaneni krishnarao hou ect ect enron samer takriti enron net stinson gibner hou ect ect enron tom halliburton corp enron enron vince j kaminski hou ect ect subjectrecplex floating license chonawee and i just had a phone conversation with cplex there are other alternatives products that may help in saving time and cost chonawee and i feel that one floating develoment license and one or two opl a package on sale that provides modeling and optimization features licenses will do in addition we need floating deployment licenses for the development licenses the charges should be split equally between the different groups that may ask for optimization help although it is hard to predict who may ask for future help we are suggesting equally since these licenses are used to develop the needed solution but are not in general used to run the software the deployment licenses can be charged on peruse basis for different groups cplex is going to send us a new quote we ll make the decision soon after that samer
