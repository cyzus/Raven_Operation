 gentlemenwe have had favorable responses regarding the use of our volatility reduction method roger i ve attached a copy of our article in case you hadn t seen it however there continued to be a quibble about how to create the set of data points that would be inputs into the testing process last week the consulting arm of a big five accounting firm indicated that the following method proposed by us would be acceptable we believe this method overcomes the statistical problems that arise from using interest rate differences from overlapping rolling quarters method calculate daily yield curve changes expressed as ratios using historical rates from the most recent say two years noteno overlap this results in a set of aroundvectors of ratios approximatelytrading days per year exampleif the first three yield curves in the historical set look like this then the change fromtoisand the change fromtois randomly selectof these ratio vectors approxtrading days in a quartermultiply these ratio vectors together to get a single vector ie themo ratios are multiplied together theyr ratios are multiplied togeter etc the result represents a single quarterly yield curve transformation apply it to today s yield curve the resulting yield curve represents one simulated quarterly change in interest ratesrepeat stepsanduntil an adequate number of yield curves are generated say proceed with testing process i would be interested in your comments leslie abreo andrew kalotay associates incbroadway stenew york nyphone fax emailleslie abreo kalotay com visit aka s website at httpwww kalotay comfas article pdf
