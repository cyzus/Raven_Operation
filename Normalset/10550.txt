 i ve a couple of suggestions here first given the excruciating experience we had last time with onetenth increments should we consider twotenths i d like to use cent increments but we re limited todecimal places secondly i ve tried to respond with a language fix for paragraphconsistent with your concern of how to handle alternate rights finally i ve done a little tinkering with the terms sheet ya ll are free to do with these what you will from susan scottam to christine stokes et s enron enron cc jeffery fawcett et s enron enron steven harris et s enron enron kevin hyatt et s enron enron lorraine lindberg et s enron enron tk lohman et s enron enron michelle lokay et s enron enron subject re tw ios posting privileged confidential christine see the attached i ve changed paragraphto be like our last posting and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery but omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time my only other comment is that i think the group needs to discuss beforehand how a shipper s request for alternate points is going to be treated as currently drafted this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate which calls into question our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount if we do intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt points at a discounted rate we should take this statement out end of paragraphif we re still living in a max rate world though this really is not much of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max rate any questions give me a call s christine stokesam to susan scott et s enron enron cc subject tw ios posting susan please review the following ios posting thanks
