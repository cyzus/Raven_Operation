 hey vince thanks for your reply i ll see what becomes of the session and keep you informed as to the paper tim crack and i have a revised version of the paper i gave you we have since found out that by using certainty equivalence our model is more robust for example if one has an asset pricing model that incorporates mean variance and skewness harvey and siddique jf juneand a binomial model that incorporates mean variance and skewness johnson paulukiewicz and mehta rqfaour model allows you to price options under the real world measure the benefit is that one can take all of the model parameters from historical data that is nonrisk neutralized from a pricing perspective there isn t a tremendous benefit in a meanvariance world variance stays the same in risk neutral or risky measure however in the meanvarianceskewness world there is a benefit because we do not believe although we re still hunting down an appropriate cite skewness is the same under riskneutral and risky measure given we can only measure the skewness in our risky world our model becomes much more significant i would certainly appreciate comments on the version of the paper you have and would also pass on the new version of the paper if you would like to see it thanks again tom
