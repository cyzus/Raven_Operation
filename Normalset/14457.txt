 karla the wording you have below sounds reasonable as we would only use the code for internal valuation purposes i also checked with vince regarding the issues we discussed by phone yesterday he would like to specify aday response time for the software support also he would like to specify that the payment schedule be at time of initial contract andat the time when the software is released this would give them an incentive to release the software before the full year is over if they want to accelerate the payment thanks again for all the help stinson fromkarla feldman onam tostinson gibner hou ect ect ccsubjectdg energy stinson while trying to put together the agreements for dg energy i have an additional questioni need to know exactly what yall plan to do with the source code once you have it after the initial one year period is upthere are still limitations as to what you can do with it so i will need to know so we can try to revise the contract so that you will be legal for example in the language regarding release of the source code from escrow it states that once you have the source code you just have the right to use copy and modify the source code solely for our internal purposes in connection with support maintenance and operation of the software do yall plan to reverse engineer decompile etcdo you plan on using any of their code to create our own productif soi think these are going to be a problem the latter would be an infringement issue unless we were to contract to do so please let me know more details of your plan so i can see how we need to proceed in this area thanks karla x
