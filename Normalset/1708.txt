 Fernley Generally this seems to be fine I think that Steve and I would like to clarify the credit limit review issue Please see him for some semantical changes to that one line Regarding the expected maximum exposure calculation I believe that this is incredibly misleading and if not changed would be inclined to forward my own interpretation WE LOST MMNOT MM I think that we should make a distinction between what has already been realized as opposed to what writedowns need to be taken but it all better add up to MM Regarding the additional exposures my impression is that our true expectation for counterparty claims is close to zero while we do expect to terminate one or more employees which would incur severance cost Ted Fernley DysonAM ToSally Beck HOU ECT ECT Ted Murphy HOU ECT ECT Wes Colwell HOU ECT ECT ccSubjectHelsinki Report Dear all I ve been through the attached with Steve Young and Mark Frevert Would welcome any thoughts comments Thanks FernleyForwarded by Fernley Dyson LON ECT on Fernley DysonToRichard Causey Corp Enron ENRON ccSubjectHelsinki Report Rick The attached report is an updated version of the document we discussed on Friday of last week Some of the numbers in the exposure analysis are still draft and I expect firm numbers in the next few hours My aim would be to streamline this report for the presentation to Joe Sutton but I would welcome your steer on how you plan to conduct the meeting and whether or not this format is appropriate Regards Fernley
