williams iii bill nonprivileged pst if the material was not specified in the scope of supplywhy is there a cost increase to begin withwhat is the well water chlorides vs city water what does the chemistry logs showregards bill w original message fromchmielewski robert sentfriday june pm todannhaus ed ccwilliams bill; wisdom michael subjectrefrom edannhauslas vegas ii power projectweekly activity report noed i checked with lvc on tube materials and condenser operating conditions for unit unit has had no indication of corrosion but the water used for cooling tower makeup is well water and is low in chlorides units will be using city water and the chlorides will be in themg l range the following is courtesy of mike wisdom and various ss manuals l ss has a moly percentage in therange in the past before computer control of alloying the mo percentage was typically in the range the testing that was done on corrosion resistance was done on mo ss l ss has a mo percentage in therange lxn ss has a mo percentage in therange the l alloys are recommended for use in high chloride concentration streams at elevated temperatures l ss would be the material of choice if the cost difference is not prohibitive i hope this helps bob chmielewski original message fromdannhaus ed sentfriam towilliams bill ccwisdom michael; chmielewski robert subjectrefrom edannhauslas vegas ii power projectweekly activity report nothe drainage ditch issue is still precipated by the eventuality that a sound wall will be constructed if the sound wall is constructed there will have to be a minimum distance that must be maintained above thefoot the added cost for higher larger towers have to be considred the drainage ditch will not be constructed for four years in the future so the transmission lines cannot extend into the easement area however if we put the culverts in now before transmission lines are constructed then the city may allow the penetration into the easement for sure if we hang transmission lines into the facility site we will get an interference claim from the contractor i will investigate farther the recommended change in condenser materials as it now stands we are only asking for the additional costs i have checked the scope of work and it is silent on the tube spec by copy the wisdom and chemielwski please provide the technical justification for the change in materials in the days when i was a member of nace ss was not recommendeed in any service that had chlorides in excess ofppm due to stress cracks caused by the chlorides
