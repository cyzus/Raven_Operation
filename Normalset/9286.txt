 michelle if you have experienced problems using tw deal analysis lately it has been fixed whenever we run tw deal analysis we have the report id generated by the database automatically unfortunately the database crashed and recovered later it did not start from the last number in the database instead it started with a very largedigit number the application did not expect to handle such a large number and could not continue i am working on changing report id generation to be manual function so that next time if database server crashes the application will not be affected sorry for the inconvenience meiling
