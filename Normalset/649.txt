 I discussed with Ted and David and they agree with Oliver s analysis below so Chris let s go ahead and report on the MM loss against UK Gas in today s notifications Then perhaps you can work with James to adjust DPR reporting accordingly going forward Thank you CassandraForwarded by Cassandra Schultz NA Enron onPMOliver Gaylard ECTPM ToCassandra Schultz NA Enron ENRON ccDavid Port Market Risk Corp Enron ENRON James New LON ECT ECT Ted Murphy HOU ECT ECT SubjectReLoss NotificationStructured Derivatives Cassandra As discussed with Ted David and yourself the loss should not be looked at on its own as it is due to movements in two markets The UK power price curve shifted and the UK gas volatility curve shifted The P L break out is as followsUK Power delta P L MM Spread options Structured derivatives gamma P LMM Spread options Structured derivatives vega P LMM UK Gas vega P L MM If prudency releases are stripped out I think if we allocate P L to the correct books we get the following total P Ls exluding reserve releasesUK Power MM UK GasMM Excludes reserve release of MM Therefore we only have a loss violation in UK gas This is not trying to avoid the MM loss notification I am only trying to represent the loss that reflects the true risk in the books of Europe Please hold off on the issue of a notification until it is decided that only a loss notification is issued for gas Rgds Oliver FromCassandra Schultz ENRONToMichael Kass EU Enron Enron Chris Abel HOU ECT ECT James New LON ECT ECT ccOliver Gaylard LON ECT ECT David Port Market Risk Corp Enron ENRON Mike Jordan LON ECT ECT Shona Wilson NA Enron Enron SubjectLoss NotificationStructured Derivatives Per discussion with Ted Murphy P L related to the Eastern spread options should be included in our Loss Notification monitoring in accordance with the Risk Management Policy However my understanding is that the positions and VaR are captured in European Gas and UK Power but the P L is reported separately in Structured Derivatives This reporting is perhaps further complicated by related prudencey being released in the line item European Gas The DPR reflects a MM loss in Structured Derivatives and Oliver indicated this represents the market moving against our Eastern spread option position This is a Ken Lay level notification by any measurement standards regardless of whether you compare it to the VAR limit for Gas or the VaR limit for UK Power Or even split it between them Chris please include this loss in today s notification letters to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling for the th Per Oliver the loss was due to power price curve shift and gas volatility curve shift against the Eastern spread options Going forward James perhaps you could work with Oliver and the commercial team to determine a reasonable methodology to support the allocation of P L and related DPR reporting for these positions so we can continue to evaluate in compliance with the policy Thank you Cassandra
