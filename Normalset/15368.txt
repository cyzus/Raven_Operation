is finally quit india time for enron though the controversialmultinational has denied plans to sell its stake in dabhol power companydpc informed sources say that it has sent feelers to china light powerand others to offload its majority holding getting out of india may be thebest course for enron though it has threatened a fight and invoked politicalforce majeure the energy review committee headed by madhav godbole willcertainly weaken its case the committee points out that the manyinfirmitiesin the dpc approval process brings into question the proprietyof the decisionsit is clear that the m that enron spent on educating indiaspolicymakers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics oftechnoeconomic appraisal or due procedure with regard to large internationalcontracts the committee says it is troubled with the failure of governancethat seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision makingprocess on matters relating to dpc the failure of governance has been broad across different governments at different points of time at both the stateand the central level and across different agencies associated withexamining the project and at both the administrative and political levels itstrains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure toexecute assigned responsibilities is purely coincidentalthough the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigatethese infirmities its two key members mr godbole and former secretary inthe ministry of finance eas sarma have asked for a judicial inquiry intothe process of clearing the dpc project other members felt a judicialinquiry would delay the negotiation process and not serve any purposethere may be some merit in an argument against a further delay inrenegotiating tariffs or facilitating enrons exit but the report certainlyprovides the central vigilance commission cvc with all the grounds that itneeds to start an investigation cvc n vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate thedeal especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign though thepolitical establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry thecvc can establish whether there are lapses on the part of governmentfunctionaries including political executivesand ensure appropriateaction against them if it is indeed able to establish undue influencein signingthe contract then maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patentlyagainst the public interest without any monetary liability the godbole committee has vindicated the stand of antienron activists whohave been opposed it since negotiations began init establishes thatenron power is expensive per se and the project needs to be renegotiated regardless of the causes for the maharashtra state electricity boards mseb financial distress also that dpcs extortionate tariffs are not merelybecause of the steep rise in petroproduct prices and rupee depreciation butmainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government enronscontract is clearly onesided; it deliberately uses expensive raw materialignoring world bank warnings has worked on fanciful demandsupplyestimates and several legal requirements and permissions in fact the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs crore more than it should every year this comprises overcharging of rs crore on account of the large regassification plant of which onlyper centof the capacity is used for dpc theres also a rscrore extra billing tothe mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of thesefacilities had been included in the capital recovery charge by charging morethan twice the operations maintenance rate stipulated by the government ofindia enron collects approximately rscrore extra every year it hasalso been collecting rscrore every year through inflated fuelconsumption claims enron has been charging atkcal kwh under the powerpurchase agreement ppa although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteedit a much lower consumption rate this gives it a fat fuel arbitrageopportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra the committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using fourdifferent exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiationarate of rsper dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupeeloans rs per dollar as reference rate for phasei rs per dollaras reference rate for phaseii and a curious rsper dollar for calculatinggovernment of india tariff forcing a reduction of these excessive chargeshas nothing to do with contract cancellation all it needs is toughnegotiation and public pressure on the political establishment the godbole committee has established that dpcs tariffs can easily be halvedif excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as thedollarisation of payments the takeorpay clause and escrow facility whichis in fact hampering msebs reform particularly in power distribution arescrapped the security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tariffwould be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system the committee also gives enron a difficult escape route it says that if themultinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous it shouldfree mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outsidemaharashtra the committee has tried to establish another precedent on allprojects negotiated by governmentthe public has a right to know what isbeing contracted on their behalfand has recommended that all documentsincluding contracts related to all independent power projects ipps particularly dpc should be published by the maharashtra government withintwo months also having established that demandsupply estimates by the state governmentwere fanciful the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations withpower producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption ofpower generation from such ipps it recommends that such negotiations shouldbe in accordance with the leastcost plan spelt out by the report thisshould also end the hectic lobbying by reliance patalganga mittalsbhadravati the bses saphale and others to set up ipps in maharashtrathe financialexpress april dpc board set to authorise president enron md to issue notice oftermination

and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issuingtermination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractualobligations under the ppa the state government and mseb sources said thatsuch a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebatepenalty of rscrore for misdeclaration and default on the availabilityof power on januaryand februarythe state government and mseb which reviewed its position on saturday at ameeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh are of the viewthat they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the

committee to cut the per unitcost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficitstates mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out orobsolete or

decisions takenin respect of the enron project at different points of time by successivegovernments and agencies in the centre and state energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav

teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government officialvinay mohan lalhas recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron powerproject deal saying it signified the utter failure of

has been acquired by outlook isseverely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar with the congressthen the day bjpled union government which reworked the deal inshiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtraheaded by manohar joshi the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost everystep of decisionmaking relating to the dabhol project madhav godbolecommittee report an investigation if ordered could embarrass at least these threegovernments the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid byenron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal according to thecommittee the deal reveals failure of governance both at the centre andstate and across different agencies it strains belief to accept that suchwidespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purelycoincidental the report said proposing a set of measures to be implementedif something of the project was to be retrieved godbole and sarma also feltthat the panel should categorically recommend the government of india toorder a judicial inquiry this was finally adopted by it says a congressleaderenron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtraand put to question liberalisation particularly in the power sector the proposal has already struck panic says ncp s praful patelif the enrondecision has at all been detrimental it is because of the haste with whichphasewas cleared by the shiv senabjp government now with the statehaving already entered into an agreement with enron the important thing isto resolve it amicably a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it snot an issue of corruption but that of perception promarket congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at thecentre and the state which invited enron even though the second phase wascleared by the bjpshiv sena combine says congress spokesperson jaipalreddyright now we re too involved with the parliament deadlock overtehelka proliberalisation congress mps also fear that such witchhuntingcould send wrong signals to foreign investors noncongress mps frommaharashtra meanwhile claim that the godbole committee was instituted withthe express purpose of politicising the enron issue i think i know vilasraodeshmukh s gameplan says an mp from the state but some mps like congressprithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy that s surrounded the deali ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee toexamine thisthe committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected toatechnoeconomic appraisal as envisaged under provisions of the electricitysupply act ofand related legislations the infirmities could have beenavoided since this wasn t done questions about a concerted effort towardsexercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arisethe exhaustive page report points out i d highlight the speed with which the day vajpayee government clearedthe project minutes before it quit says congress mp prithviraj chavan the enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impendingliberalisation in the early s and despite several controversies is nowan established power project at dabholkm south of mumbai in julyenron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board mseb toset up a mw station as part of the government s fast track projectssubsequently when the shivsenabjp came to power in maharashtra it filed awrit against the project this curiously led to renegotiations with enron the committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated dealonce it gom decided to revive the project it acted in the very samemanner its predecessors in office had done it forgot all about competitivebidding and transparency the speed with which the negotiating group studiedthe project and made its proposal for renegotiatons which was accepted bydabhol is unprecedented says chavani would particularly like tohighlight the speed with which the day vajpayee government at centreendorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned since the commissioning of the plant in maythe mseb has paid rscrore for the power it has bought from dabhol if the same watttage of powerhad been bought from indianbuilt power plants fired by indigenous coal thepayment would have been approximately rscrore in the firstyearandahalf of its operation itself the dpc had drained the maharashtraexchequer of nearly rs crore the central electricity authority cea in fact pointed out that the dabholplant was not the least costly option the mseb had other inexpensivealternatives like the four units of kaparkheda but they were in apreliminary stage the report notesif the mseb had made efforts toseriously pursue these projects they might not have remained in theirpreliminary stages it adds that the members were of the opinion that themseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously based on informationavailable at that time in proceeding with the dpc as a baseload factor evenwhen its capacity was reduced the failure seems to have been compounded bythe laxity of the union power ministry finance ministry and the cea itquotes the cea as saying that since the union finance ministry found thetariff reasonable no further examination was required strangely bal thackeray s shiv sena when it came to power together with thebjp in maharashtra filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal after the new shiv senabjp government took over its cm manohar joshi appointed a renegotiating committee inwhich made the right noises actually managing to reduce the tariff but certain things remainedinexplicable no fresh clearances were required from the cea which also saidthat since no cost increase was involved fresh formal clearance wasn tnecessary says the committeethis only adds strength to the suspicionthat the cea didn t consider the economic aspects of the project at all indeed given the nonavailability of any official record of the meeting onjune with the committee and the nature of this letter dateddecember the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects ofdpc were discussed at all the credibility of the shiv senabjp government has been seriouslyquestioned the committee finds it unexplicable sic why there was nomention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from millionto million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiatingcommittee the panel observes says lawyer prashant bhushanit is strangethat the shiv senabjp government first filed a writ in the court and thencoolly renegotiated the deal the committee further spells out the lossesincurred through the deal subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc thefinancial deterioration of mseb has been rapid while the mseb was in profitinit plunged into huge losses of rscrore insignificantly the world bank inhad predicted the system s inherentweaknesses in a letter written to the then power secretary r vasudevan atop bank official had said that after a detailed review of the analyticalframework and costing assumptions we reconfirm our earlier conclusion thatthe dabhol project as presently formulated is not economically justified and that in our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb systeminthe proposed baseload operation could result in uneconomic plantdispatch as already existing lower variable cost coal power would bereplaced by the higher cost lng power enron s persistence and the gullibility of

india papers i feel that the world bankopinion can be changed we ll engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the mediafrom here on the project has solid support from all other agencies inwashington the key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state likemaharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at allfor thefirst time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability ofsuch a project according to the report the mseb has been one of the betterperforming boards in the country and has despite a faulty transmission anddistribution t and d system managed to consistently earn net revenuesurpluses on an accrual basis maharashtra accounts for nearly onefourth of the gross value of india sindustrial sector it s one of the few states to achieveper centelectrification sincethe mseb has been adding to its generation thisimprovement which has been largely due to renovation and modernisationundertaken by the mseb exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpcwas being considered the report points out following a policy ofcrosssubsidy roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasntbeen much in fact the subsidy claim decreased from rscrore in to rscrore inuntil init increased nearly fivefoldto rs crore due to the sudden increase in the gap bypaise per unitfromtopaisean increase ofper cent the increase in the subsidyclaim by rs crore is due to the increase in the gap principally becauseof the increase in power purchase costs says the committee

recommendationsmake public all dabholrelateddocuments and agreements restructure the dabhol project itself to bring downthe cost of power restructure dpc financially allow sale of dpc poweroutside

the negotiating table the mseb has turned toputting its house in order as if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termedas the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis the
