williams iii bill nonprivileged pst we aremws long heat palo verde in the realtime position manager i printed a forward obligation report for the th and that report does not reflect this length after checking every deal at pv for the th against the forward obligation report it appears that our deals have been entered correctly i discussed this with holden and he agrees there is no reason we should be long at pv for that day therefore the correct position at pv for the th is flat the length is false if you are aware of any deals that may have caused the realtime position manager to reflect this length please let me know thanks stacy runswick enron north america ph fx stacy runswick enron com
