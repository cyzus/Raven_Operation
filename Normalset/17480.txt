 tanya while there is seasonal correlations in power especially for np and sp same region the term structure of correlations can be input however the same correlation structure with similar periodicity may not hold between np and say rb neepool though one would imagine that relationship would still be seasonal summer winter with greater noise even if the correlational term structure is to be done for power different rules would have to be inputted for different regions naveen tanya tamarchenko ectam tovladimir gorny hou ect ect naveen andrews corp enron enron cckirstee hewitt lon ect ect debbie r brackett hou ect ect wenyao jia hou ect ect vince j kaminski hou ect ect subjectreimplementing termstructure of correlations for power vlady naveen i am sending you the factor loadings for power calculated based on the prices from jun to sep they look rather messy thus joint estimation of factors for a few regions does not look realistic instead we might implement the term structure of correlations instead of heavingcorrelation matrix based on prompt month prices and applying this matrix to all maturities we can have a number correlation matrices each corresponding to a particular prompt month i attached the term structure of correlations between r and r calculated usingmonths of historical forward prices prior to sep with and without decay factor you can see that the results are close for andmonths of history;correlations are periodic with a period ofyear this means we can usecorrelation matrices calculated from firstforward contracts and apply these matrices to other forward months ;using decay factor makes the curves a little smoother implementation of multiple correlation matrices will not affect the speed of calculations in var model significantly please give me your response thanks tanya
