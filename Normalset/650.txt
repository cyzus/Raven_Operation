 One of Market Risk s primary responsibilities is to review Enron s trading activities and provide feedback to management and management s expectation is that this is feedback and analysis is provided at the beginning of the Houston trading day Global Risk Management Operations in Houston is now providing Market Risk with a Enron Consolidated Preliminary DPR prior toa m Houston time for use in Market Risk s morning meeting where we review all of Enron s trading activities from the prior day The only information missing from this is the UK and I understand we do not receive the London DPR untila mpm your time I m sure you re working toward obtaining a final DPR earlier in the day but meanwhile we d like to obtain a preliminary DPR that Global Ops can consolidate for Houston management s use first thing in the morning as decisions need to be made each day based on Enron s consolidated exposure etc We understand they re preliminary but we work off preliminarys from Houston and I expect with thehour time difference your preliminarys will be much firmer than ours We can start with just P L and VaR so it s not that manys we need I m hoping when we get the RisktRAC feeds complete we ll be able to see positions earlier as well Please let us know when we can begin receiving this information Thank you Cassandra Schultz VP Market Risk Management workcellhome
