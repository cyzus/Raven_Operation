williams iii bill nonprivileged pst billcan you make sure that everyone in real time knows that if the iso calls to remove a waiver for a generator the services desk needs to be notified last evening apparently the iso called and removed a waiver for harbor with craig and we were not notified it is not his fault as we have not communicated the importance of this but from now on we need to be notified this is because we will need to put in supplementals or at least be aware that we could be dispatched at any time once the waiver is pulled it also gives us a heads up that the iso needs energy thanks c chris foster chris h foster enron com w cell
