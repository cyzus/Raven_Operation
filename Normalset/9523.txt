cfm umalternate urlhttpwww cera com client ce alt ce alt ab html as western markets continue to struggle through high august demand and prices for both power and natural gas september looms as the start of the fall shoulder season the shoulder season historically has brought the possibility of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from summer levels cera expects this shoulder season to differ from years past however with power and gas markets producing strong yearoveryear prices and little relief from summer levels even with normal september weather westwide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in june a month with high power prices in addition compared with june levels hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows leaving more expensive gasfired generation to replace declining hydroelectric output cera expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push onpeak prices in the west topercent over septemberlevels continued strong use of gasfired generation in the west as well as low us storage inventories and tight supply demand balances will keep the pressure on gas prices topock prices are expected to average per million british thermal units mmbtu in september these high september gas and power prices are driven by declining hydroelectric output the months of september through november represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the west with rainfall historically boosting output in december approximately average megawatts amw will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the threemonth period this represents a net reduction in capacity of amw when compared with the recent juneaugust summer months and a reduction of amw when compared with septemberlevels higher more variable power demand the southwest and southern california still experience hot weather in september and regional utilities typically consider it possible that a year s peak load event will occur in september spiking loads however can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather thus power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree of variability during september high levels of gasfired generation load growth and a declining hydroelectric resource base will require gasfired resources to serve approximately the same level of demand as in junea month with similar average demand and monthly average onpeak power prices in the per megawatthour mwh range depending on the region this strong pull on gasfired plants will push deep into the generation resource base driving prices upward an additional billion cubic feet bcf per day will be required for gasfired generators in the us west compared with septemberlevels strong north american gas prices natural gas prices are expected to retain most of this summer s peak levels as north american supplies remain tight a market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price retreat this fall as a result average september henry hub prices are expected to trade around per mmbtu an active storm season could keep henry hub prices near the mark strong western basis differentials the strong demand for gas to serve gasfired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis differentials at high levels especially in the california markets cera expects a topocktohenry hub differential of per mmbtu during september extended operational problems associated with el paso s pipeline rupture would raise that outlook regional power market drivers hotterthannormal august weather transmission and generator outages high natural gas prices and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a rise in power price levels during august southern california average power prices in august have thus far exceeded july levels by an average ofper mwh during the onpeak period and byper mwh during the offpeak period midcolumbia power prices bearing the brunt of fireinduced transmission outages experienced a jump from july price levels ofper mwh for the onpeak period andper mwh in the offpeak period offpeak prices which have averaged aboveper mwh during the juneaugust period are clearly defined by the production cost of gasfired resources onpeak prices during this same period at overper mwh in all regions in all months have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of the marginal system generator see tablea return to normal weather should drive westwide loads down by amw in september from august levels however load growth and a return to normal weather are expected to push loads up by amw when compared with septemberlevels these greater loads coupled with a reduction in hydroelectric generation of amw from last september s levels will create supply tightness during september see tablesandhydroelectric coal and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to serve westwide demand in september even during much of the offpeak periods requiring gasfired resources to meet a significant portion of the load gas demand for power generation is expected to average bcf per day in september down from over bcf per day in august but up by a dramatic bcf per day compared with levels in septemberseptember power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost of gasfired generation approximatelyper mwh with prices frequently higher as demand increases as this summer has clearly demonstrated prices rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight hot weatherinduced loads should provide additional examples of this relationship cooler or hotterthannormal weather in september coupled with the inherent high variability of september loads will produce a wide range of price outcomes under normal weather onpeak power prices are expected to fall in the per mwh range depending on location representing apercent premium to yearago september prices see figurethe latest revision of the california independent system operator s iso s imbalance energy market cap down toper mwh is expected to depress market prices during any weather events in september cera expects the iso price cap to limit prices outside of california as well pacific northwest although demand levels in the pacific northwest are expected to retreat in september by at least amw compared with those in the hotterthannormal month of august the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources will amount to amw over the same period see tablethus the pacific northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to other regions with transmission interties operating at below rated capacity during this period power prices in the pacific northwest will maintain their tight relationship with those in northern california these price levels will continue to support the operation of the region s limited quantity of gasfired generation midcolumbia onpeak price levels are expected to averageper mwh in september offpeak power price levels in the pacific northwest will also receive a boost from the strong markets to the south the expected september level ofper mwh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding markets california the fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that separates the west into markets that lie north of transmission pathand those to the south as in years past hydrodepleted northern california should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources within the region exports from the pacific northwest dwindle and energy from the nuclear and coalrich southwest is constrained from entering northern california by pathimport limitations this condition which is expected to persist from september through november allows northern california to price at a premium the expected monthly average onpeak northern california price ofper mwh incorporates this dynamic notably the california iso is completing a process to remap the zones in california in part to capture locational price differences more effectively southern california like the southwest will typically experience hot weather episodes in september during these high demand periods prices will rise to peak levels as experienced this summer in addition california as a whole should see average loads in september that are amw higher than those of septemberoccasional cooler weather will sharply but temporarily reduce daily prices southern california benefits from the abundant export capacity of the southwest during cooler weather in that region allowing prices to fall well below those in northern california anper mwh differential between the north and south portions of the state is expected with southern california onpeak prices averagingper mwh offpeak prices ofandper mwh for northern and southern california respectively reflect the continued need for gasfired resources to support september offpeak loads rockies and southwest an extended period of hot weather in july and august has boosted demand in the rockies a region with growing saturation of residential air conditioning limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports from surrounding regions have allowed the rockies to price temporarily at a premium to all other regions in the west a return to normal weather in september should restore the previously tight relationship of rockies prices to those in the north rockies prices are expected to fall with loads with a september monthly onpeak price average ofper mwh and an offpeak price average ofper mwh cera expects southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in southern california on a monthly average basis the two regions generally experience the same september weather patterns and a strong mw transmission link between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other strong gas prices and occasional market tightnessinduced price runups will maintain onpeak prices at theper mwh level in september offpeak prices will like those in southern california be buoyed by the high cost of gasfired generation a price level ofper mwh is expected for offpeak prices regional gas market drivers the summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in north america with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition even as the summer power peak subsides in september across the united states the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in the gulf will keep prices high and volatile the storage deficit now stands at approximatelybcf and us storage inventories look likely to head into winter at historically low levels this critical storage situation will keep prices high despite overall declines in power loads in september cera expects a henry hub price of per mmbtu during september in the west strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist through september especially in california overall total demand for gas is expected to decline across the west from bcf per day during august to bcf per day during september see tablethis load will tend to keep intraregional differentials wide throughout the west during the month the recent price disconnects between the supplyrich rocky mountains and san juan basin and demandcharged california will persist october should bring some change in this dynamic as heating loads in the rockies begin to increase in general winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing differentials throughout the west the summer pressure on rocky mountain supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be relieved somewhat by regional heating loads declines in flows into the san juan basin from the rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in the san juan on the other hand healthy california storage inventories should limit price premiums at topock through the heating season the startup of the new alliance pipeline which will draw gas to the midwest will support prices in the pacific northwest and california california topock continues to be the premium pricing point in north america although differentials between southern california and the henry hub subsided somewhat from peak levels near per mmbtu before this weekend s pipeline explosion total imports into california reached record levels during july; total imports of bcf per day eclipsed the previous high bymillion cubic feet mmcf per day see tablepipeline capacity into the state during the month ran atpercent utilization so far in august pipeline capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate running atpercent these high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices in southern california and the pressure should continue during september total demand in california is expected to decline somewhat during september but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation will provide support total demand in the state should average bcf per day down only slightly from august s total of bcf per day flows into the state between august and september are not likely to change significantly but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand the topock differential to the henry hub should average approximately per mmbtu for september see tablestorage inventories in the west are still healthy relative to levels in the rest of the united states but the storage surplus in the region has eroded in california inventories are running lower than last year and the deficit in the state looks likely to widen during september the end of injection season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of topock differentials to winter price spikes pacific northwest malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that topock prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the rocky mountains and san juan basins have shown so far this month prices at malin are averaging a per mmbtu discount to the henry hub pipeline capacity into the region from the rocky mountains is running nearly full; flows on pgt out of alberta have averaged nearly bcf per day this month export capacity out of the region on pge gt nw is running close to capacity and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong california demand are driving the wide malintotopock differentials continuing strong demand in the south will likely keep topock prices strong and the wide northsouth differentials within the west will likely hold through september in the pacific northwest demand is expected to climb through september to bcf per day from bcf per day in august this demand level should keep malin differentials from widening from current levels for september cera expects malin prices to average per mmbtu below the henry hub price southwest prices in the san juan basin this summer have been left behind by rising california demand although the westward pull on supplies is strong bottlenecks between california and the san juan have led to disconnects between san juan prices and topock prices pipeline capacity utilization rates on transwestern and the northern leg of el paso reachedpercent during july with less thanmmcf per day of excess pipeline capacity increased flows from the rockies on transcolorado and northwest are contributing to downward pressure on san juan basin supply and in general the san juan has followed rocky mountain prices rather than following prices at topock or the permian basin unlike in the past two summers the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the west coast to support san juan prices relative to permian prices the differential between san juan and permian has averaged per mmbtu so far this month and per mmbtu since june additional imports from the rockies into the san juan have increased supply bymmcf per day relative to last summer but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect without much change in southwestern or rocky mountains local demand the san juan should continue to price at a wide discount during september the san juantohenry hub differential is expected to average per mmbtu as in the rockies differentials should narrow substantially in october rocky mountains downward pressures on rocky mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region; generation is still largely coalbased and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal cera expects the heavy discountcurrent rocky mountaintohenry hub differentials are around per mmbtuto persist through september local area demand is not expected to change during september substantial gain in local demand comes in october with heating loads; october demand should average bcf per day up from august and september averages of around bcf per day although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the rockies winter differentials are expected to stay in the to per mmbtu range strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader north american markets this summer next summer pressures on rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer although pipeline expansion projects have been announcedtrailblazer and williams announced expansion plans this summerthe new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer cera expects supplies within the rocky mountains to increase bymmcf per day next year western canada after widening to over us per mmbtu the aecohenry differential has begun to narrow somewhat; maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from per mmbtu in july with current supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes having to pay full cost to flow differentials are likely to persist in the miduss per mmbtu for september aeco is expected to be us per mmbtu c per gigajoule for september even with the startup of the alliance project the contract nonrenewal on transcanada is likely to continue the twotiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted pipeline costs this will result in differentials that will range between us and us per mmbtu throughout the winter supply build in western canada continues to languish behind last year s levels the pace of drilling over gas wells are expected this year should provide growth in the fourth quarter and intosupply is expected to be flat withon an annual basis for this year and up at leastmmcf per day insumas prices have been quite volatile driven by both weather in the pacific northwest and maintenance on the westcoast system for september sumas is expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to aeco of us per mmbtu end follow url for pdf version of
