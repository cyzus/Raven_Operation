 hi vince been meaning to ask for your input about larry thorpe s proprietary model for electricity returns i have not been able to get much information about the parameters as larry says the nature is proprietary it is hard to make a judgement about its usefulness without such information larry s emails to me indicate that he is working on np real time prices and he promises to share the results with us please advise on direction to take as i am not quite sure about the model without further information separately larry indicated that you had promised him some data and would like to know if you have forwarded it to him i can convey your position to him thanks
