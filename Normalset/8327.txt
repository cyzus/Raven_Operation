 adding to kristin s update here s the summary of a meeting that just occured with assembly leadership staff and industry on the assembly s latest version of an edison mou the speaker s staffer said that if he had to bet at this time he would betthat the assembly would not convene on friday he also said that if it doesn t happen on friday nothing will happen until they get back from recess on the th of august the assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whetherthey intend to move forward with a vote on friday or recess from the most recent proposal released today by the assembly leadership itappears that the centrist democrats are prevailing the proposalretains direct access though they said that they are continuing to be pressured by the treasurer who wants da suspended due to the bond issuance placesof edison s past debt with large customers leavingwith small customers which business customers or strenuously opposing eliminates all references to any purchase or option to purchase edison s transmission they said there simply ain t the votes to buy or consider buying edison s transmission in the assembly maintains the senate provision which would pay the banks pay the qfs butplace with edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the billion owed to suppliers even the munis are begining to complain about those provisions creates a tradeable renewable portfolio standard conceptually similar to the one created in texas the new bill is created byamending sb andgutting a different billpassed from the senate to the assembly sb and replacing it with the new version of xx the two would go together to create the assembly s newest proposal if this bill gets voted out of the assembly it will likely have a difficult time getting the votes necessary to pass in the senate since the senate has considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the assembly version will report back on whether the assembly s going forward or adjourning for recess as soon as we hear best jeffforwarded by jeff dasovich na enron onpm kristin walsh enron enronxgatepm tojohn j lavorato enron enronxgate louise kitchen enron enronxgate david w delainey hou ees ees ccchristopher f calger enron enronxgate christian yoder enron enronxgate steve c hall enron enronxgate mike swerzbin enron enronxgate phillip k allen enron enronxgate jeff dasovich na enron enron chris gaskill enron enronxgate mike grigsby enron enronxgate tim heizenrader enronenronxgate vince j kaminski enron enronxgate steven j kean enron enronxgate rob milnthorp enron enronxgate kevin m presto enron enronxgate claudio ribeiro enron enronxgate richard shapiro enron enronxgate james d steffes enron enronxgate mark tawney enron enronxgate scott tholan enron enronxgate britt whitman enron enronxgate lloyd will enron enronxgate alan comnes enron enronxgate rogers herndon enron enronxgate james w lewis hou ees ees don black hou ees ees kelly holman enron enronxgate mark dana davis hou ect ect fletcher j sturm enron enronxgate doug gilbertsmith enron enronxgate richard b sanders enron enronxgate andrew edison enron enronxgate kelly holman enron enronxgate nancy turner enron enronxgate tim belden enron enronxgate john brindle enron enronxgate david cromley enron enronxgate subjectcalifornia updatep details are still rough and the situation is very fluid but here is what is currently going onsenators hertzberg and keeley are amending both sb xx and ab xx upon an initial read it appears that they are doing the following ab xx has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and therenewables portfolio the core noncore business provisions the transmission asset purchase etc all appear to have been deleted both of theseprovisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by members last week when the bill was first debatedit appears amendments have been made to sb xx but the extent of thesechanges are not yet knownat the beginning of both amended bills it states as proposed to be amended into sb xx this means that amendments to sbcould be incorporated into aband vice versa another possibility is an entirely new bill
