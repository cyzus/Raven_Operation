 Thanks David I am addressing the undue influence issue via the PRC process but we all know that this is a partial solutionit s about changing the culture Europe isn t any better or worse in this respect and this is a more intransigent problem that we need to work at every single day I have to say that the Helsinki scare was really helpful in this respectI think you would notice a difference I ll ask James and Mike to follow up on your specific points Regards Fernley FromDavid Port ENRONToFernley Dyson LON ECT ECT ccSteve W Young LON ECT ECT Ted Murphy HOU ECT ECT Sally Beck HOU ECT ECT SubjectReUK Gas late deal input and deal booking errorso m hit Sorry to hear about this one I have some observations to make from my reading and rereading of the account It looks like the old undue influence problem again It seems some attempts were made by operations to follow up but nothing happened We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don t have any way to protect them if they dothere is still the fear that if they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career And that is because twice a year at the PRC that can happen This incident shows some of these attributes For the operations process to be effective there has to be and be seen to be little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of the operations staffWhoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm the basis on which they signed itWhy wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers Brokerage is in the P L and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage is at the agreed rate they should simply pay the brokerageTwo weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptableit should be done same day I would not have waited for the traders to do it but I would want to know why it took them so longGiven that these short trades were absent from the portfolio during a highly volatile period of rising prices I would wonder about motivation in addressing the position during this time Essentially if it had been correct we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did I would pursue

SubjectUK Gas late deal input and deal booking errorso m hit On the th of June Gas Risk Management became aware that two late trades had been entered into the gas trader s Blue book which were both being booked significantly late and had a material negative P L impact negative o m The late deals were done on the rd of February Marcello Romano and the th of March Haakon Olafson and were both forward starting sells for periods inBackgroundInput errors For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most significant number coming form the UK Gas traders Numerous errors have been found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness of entering deals into the blue book the Gas traders are currently the only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation systemthere is currently a big push to change this which has the support of John Sherriff with a deadline date ofJuly In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen A log of all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May which highlights an error rate of of non EOL trades This has been discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expectedDeal booking and reconciliation process Non EOL trades Deals are initially written into the blue book by the gas traders when the deal is done This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day Faxed broker statements are received usually by documentation the next day and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by documentation liasing with the traders as necessary At this time brokers were faxing one statement per trade relevant laterNew Deal sign off As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and the implied origination P L For the rd of February Marcello signed off the new deals sheet and for the th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed offDocumentation convention In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation relevant later Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after trade bookingBrokerage invoices Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to authorise for payment Any deals which cannot be found are raised with documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders Specific details of these late tradesSummary For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving or can it be established that we did not receive a broker statement which is a primary control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals As Enron was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements in April and was completed by the th with the invoices falling due for payment on the th The work practice at that time was that brokerage invoices including those with non reconciling trade queries were batched together and passed to the traders This would have taken place on the th of April Details on exactly what was said and done in theweeks between passing these invoices to the traders for approval although there are claims that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions and when a mailed follow up was made on the nd of May are hazy What is clear is that on the nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted Enron to try to confirm their position which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals being booked on the th of JuneDeal specifics EES BrokerMorgan Stanley trade onFebTrader Marcello EES

copy of broker confirm was requested Deal enteredJune after traders checked the tapes Who was at fault and where did the control break down I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that can be made and drawn Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas trader s accuracy and prioritisation of booking trades Despite numerous conversations on the subject very little improvement has been seen It has now got to the stage where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the error was and who made it This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to avoid the incidence of errors such as this The current error rate isof non EOL trades Documentation currently estimate that intimes out ofthe broker or counterparty are correct Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived Most brokers have now changed but one or two still send one statement per trade Reconciliation s of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow up more vigorously and by mail errors and omissions on a more timely basis There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders This is causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment Action Points Trading Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis Trade Support Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual deal statements All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the broker records Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree our forward position from Julyto Septemberthe traded part of the curve
