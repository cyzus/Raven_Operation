 vincewe can detect hoarding of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against the actual inflowwe can detect market power by dissociating the seller from the buyer distinguishing between the physical cost in gas to run the generators and the transmission cost in dollars i e the basisas you noted we can detect storage as the difference between inflow and consumption it appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model of gas pricesflow rates at interconnects from telemetry and spotmarket prices there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing capacity as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts the dynamics of gas prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for the weather as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviorshoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas we can calibrate the price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage and the price elasticities of demand for transmission as well as the extent of hoarding from the two sets of numbers mentionedflows and prices what the basis trader needs to understand are the incentives and disincentives for storage and capacityhoarding in terms of the calibrated priceelasticities and each of these are asif exotic call options at the consumption hub finally flows are explained by the model and can be imputed from prices if necessary resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of the weather i believe the problem is quite tractable and i would like to proceed with a model clayton
