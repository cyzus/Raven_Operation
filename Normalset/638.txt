 We have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the DPRReturn on VaR ROVAR Curve Shift P L DeltaGamma Sharpe Ratio RiskReturn Large RiskReturn Small All of these graphs deal with the concept of riskadjusted return The markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics Furthermore Enron s appetite for risk also differs in each market As a result it is difficult to compare returns in absolute terms Therefore the approach of these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk in effect restating return numbers into a standard base how many dollars we earn for every dollar we put at risk For each business unit or commodity group the ROVAR graph shows an average of daily total P L divided by an average of daily VaR Higher ROVARs indicate better performance relative to other business units For each business unit or commodity group there are two barsthe dark blue on the left shows ROVAR on aweekbusiness day rolling basis and the light blue on the right shows ROVAR on aweekbusiness day rolling basis Because of the shorter term theweek ROVAR is more sensitiveit can be quite high or low and it changes frequently The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept; it shows an average of daily curve shift P L both delta and gamma divided by its standard deviation This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by nontrading P L like new deals reserves and so forth Furthermore whereas VaR is a forward looking statistic the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given probability standard deviation is backward looking the actual volatility of our returns over the period This graph also has two bars for every business unit or commodity groupa dark brown on the left showing the Sharpe ratio on aweek rolling basis and a light brown on the right showing the ratio on aweek basis The Curve Shift P L Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other well They measure different things but if our P L is composed mostly of curve shift and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift volatility the two statistics should be very close Sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the P L relative to the risk We therefore put together the RiskReturn graphs On the vertical axis they showweek rolling average P L On the horizontal they showweek rolling average VaR The various business units are plotted as points on the graphs These graphs are closely related to the week ROVARs in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is the business unit s ROVAR average P L average VaR Another way of looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin with the plotted point of a business unit is its ROVAR Books with small risks and returnsmillion are plotted on the Small graph and the rest on the Large These graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize and capture the information that is reported in the DPR Most but not all of the information in the DPR currently flows from the database As a result we do not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit As we continue to set up exports into the database we will fill in the missing numbers We will email you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the intranet Please remember to launch the file in Excel instead of using the Lotus Notes viewer The VaR Limit Usage graphs that we created last week are already on the web We hope that you find all of these useful Regards Eugenio Perez
