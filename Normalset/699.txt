 This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option pricing model Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts puts and calls are priced at the same level no matter what the index The change will result in raising call values lowering put values at locations with index premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts In addition index plus minus option deals for example index putswhich are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option the index put is priced flat to the index putwill be accurately priced to reflect the difference in strikes If anyone has any questions please call me atThank You Larry May
