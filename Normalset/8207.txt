 mike this is an old problem but louise would like to discuss to ensure your communication approach today is more consistent with our visions and values lets discuss chris chris calgeroriginal message

ect ect anna gardiner lon ect ect arfan aziz lon ect ect donna greif hou ect ect subjectreapproval procedure for pending products we are introducing functionality which will allow token reference periods for balance of month products the scheduled process will therefore recreate these products every day automatically essentially just a change to the description therefore the product will already be there in the mean time all of the other desks have been creating their products ahead of time to deal with this issuewe currently have most desks creating products weeks months in advance this software change is scheduled for friday to prevent traders from going through this issue next month february we have onlylogged taped phone calls to the helpdesk when portland office has called the helpdesk with regard to this issue clearly in the second case we see aminute gap but this appears to be a single incident and not really something of the level of significance specified in your memo dale does come in early specifically for any products portland did not create the day before but obviously there can be times bad traffic when he may be late cst j richter called to approve products products activated products withinminutes cst j richter called to approve products cst anna gardiner approved products cst j richter called to inquire on status cst helpdesk rang j richter back to check that he had seen approval and had no technical problems clearly we are not intentionally trying to create a problem but enrononline is a new product and everyone is putting an immense amount of effort into getting the product up and running and helping everyone we only seem to havetimes that the procedure has been used to the helpdesk extent and not failed dramatically changing the procedure for two days assuming succesful implementation of the tokenized reference periods when we are all working to keep the system up and running and keep all customers informed of developments may create more problems if we do not introduce this software change on friday we should review this policyi obviously have no problem with tim approving such products as we will be moving to that level of authority shortly anyway michael etringer `pm tolouise kitchen lon ect ect cctim belden hou ect ect chris h foster hou ect ect dale neuner hou ect ect subjectapproval procedure for pending products i would like to talk with you concerning our current procedure for daily approval of newly created products it is not working the current procedure is for us to create the product and call dale neuner and let him know its out there if dale is not in the office or it is before or after normal work hours the traders need to call the help desk who in turn calls amita in the london office who then approves the product the portland office starts trading at am ppt in the event a product is not created ahead of time they create the product in the morning this morning the traders had several daily products pending approval it tookminutes to get those products approved on daily products the trading period may last onlyhour as a result the trader missed most of the trading period our customers are not happy and neither are the traders a solution was proposed in december which i have attached below to address this issue however it only works in the ideal world it would be overly optimistic to think that we are going to be able to always be able to create our products ahead of time that is not the reality by rolling out our products we have created an implicate contract with our customers that we will consistently make markets in the products we trade i would like to propose an alternate solution we need a direct method for tim belden to have approval rights to approve existing products these are not new products we trade them every day there is no reason tim should not have a level of approval to at the very least approve existing products especially where the only change is the term please call tim belden ator myself atlook forward to hearing from you regards mike etringer forwarded by dale neuner hou ect onamfromdonna greif onpm toeol call center

products that they will need for the next business day at the end of their day i will always check for draft products at the end of my day and activate any that are in draft just fyi gas trading has adopted the practice of creating their products a couple of days or weeks in advance i keep track of those and keep their products current in advance it works very welli am usually at my desk no later than a m each day if trading creates a draft product that they need activated prior to that time they should contact the call center atand state the followingthis is portland power trading and i need a product activated asap please contact amita gosalia in london the call center will then contact amita who has the authority and responsibility for activating products amita has agreed to perform this function for portland power and will instruct her people at pcglondon to locate her immediately in the event that she is away from her desk when this message comes in from the call center donna
