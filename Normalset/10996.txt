 strong demand holds load factors high despite alliance the introduction of the bcf d alliance pipeline into the north american gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western canada than expected according to representatives of transcanada pipelines pg e gas transmission and alliance extremely strong gas demand in the pacific northwest california and in the midwest has produced continued high load factors on transcanada and pg e gtnw despite the presence of their huge new rival for western canadian supply the contract picture changed significantly on [transcanada] since the first of november and primarily at our empress ab delivery point into the transcanada mainline from the alberta pipe but actual physical gas flows [at aboutbcf d] have not changed correspondingly said klaus exner director of pipeline system operations at transcanada the big picture overview that i would give you is that demand is very high in the pacific northwest and california and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down that leg of our pipeline system out of alberta through british columbia and into the pg e systems that hasn t let up at all and we don t foresee that letting up pg e gas transmission spokeswoman sandra mcdonough said pg e gtnw has been running full at bcf d for some time and is deliveringmmcf d to noncalifornia load in the pacific northwest we re turning back demand right now every power plant in this region is running full tilt tuscarora [gas transmission] the nevada pipeline is full our northwest deliveries are fixed we re delivering as much as we can deliver right now transcanada s other major export route out of the western canadian sedimentary basin is the foothills and northern border route into the midwest it also continues to operate at high load factors we didn t see a huge dropoff in physical flows post novwe ve seen the it volumes come up considerably said exner the one thing that has changed is the volatility of the flows customers are making frequent intraday nomination changes and we re seeing more up and down and daytoday variations according to the weather and the markets than we would have when we had a higher firm contract level the fluctuations are driven purely by the price differential between aeco and the dawn hub in ontario which indicates whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not alliance pipeline spokesman jack crawford said the system has been running flat out at about bcf d since the valves were opened for commercial service deche also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase flows on the system it has been estimated that alliance could increase gas flows to bcf d with existing compression the additional capacity would be divided up among existing shippers crawford said we haven t cranked up the system above the contract capacity yet we probably won t do that for a couple weeks until we get things ironed out frankly though i m not sure chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the pacific northwest and california
