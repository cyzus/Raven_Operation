 As requested I have come up with a rough estimate of the cost per trade for Clickpaper from a Product Control Group Call Center prospective only The average cost per month for the team fully loadedsalaries benefits plus expenses is The average number of trades per month is therefore the average costper trade As a comparison the average cost per EnronOnline trade As you can see it is much lower due to the volume of transactions We will recognize the same economies of scale when the Clickpaper trades increase We do not anticipate needing any additional staff this year Please let me know if you have any questions Sheri
