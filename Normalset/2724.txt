 ngi s daily gas price index published october ferc issues nopr on intraday recalls of released capacity given the inability of the natural gas standardssetting organization to resolve the issue of intraday recalls of released transportation capacity ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to renominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline existing gas industry standards board gisb standards require a shipper that wants to renominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later thana m central clock time cct on a nomination day at the latest and bars partialday recalls of capacity ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and renominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intraday nomination opportunities by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly they will have greater incentive to release capacity providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service at the same time this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission s regulations the nopr said [rm] existing gisb standards applying to capacityrelease recalls were adopted inwhen there was only one nomination per day at a m cct and a single nonstandardized intraday nomination it noted but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities given the lack of consensus supporting gisb s existing recall standards and the standardssetting group s failure to settle the issue the commission is forced to resolve the policy question regarding partialday recalls the nopr said permitting partialday recalls of released capacity the commission concluded was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in orderthe natural gas supply association ngsa which represents major producers and houstonbased dynegy let ferc know that they weren t big fans of partialday recalls these could undermine system reliability they contend by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems overruns penalties or operational flow orders but the commission discounted these arguments [t]he use of partialday recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements in effect releasing shippers using partialday recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation partialday recalls will be no more likely to result in shutin production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards the nopr noted
