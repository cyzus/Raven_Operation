 hi christie when do you sleep am ugh ok you were correct my invitation was to those people within enron that the students talked with before interviewing competitors and it was an invitation to the presentation only i didn t think any of them would be invited to the dinner and probably none will even come to the presentation the invitation did elicit one request for the final report though so maybe it wasn t a complete waste i didn t realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit that sounds great i wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game that would have made the whole slumming experience better now they ll get the royal treatment at enron field it ll be great vince invitedpeople from ricedennis w loughridge director of energy consortium; lounghrid rice edu carrie miller director of mba program; cmiller rice edu deborah barrett inst communications barrett rice edu dr wil uecker associate dean for executive education uecker rice edu loughridge wrote back saying he ll come i don t know about the others here are thestudents emailsritwikronnie ghoshghoshr rice eduivy ghoseghosei rice eduluigi calabreseluigical rice edupravas sudpravas rice edusyedfarhan iqbaliqbal rice edu cwomack rice eduyourfrom rice makes a total offrom rice i guess let me know if you would like me to do anything else related to monday look forward to seeing you then ken
