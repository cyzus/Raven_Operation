 hi everybody following up on our discussions on stressing correlations i made a spreadsheet and a dll here is what it doesin the input main sheet the user has to specifythe size of the correlation matrix; the row and column for the element he wants to stress rowand colin the example the integer number n iter; the original correlation matrix in the output see sheet results we seecolumnsthe first column contains possible correlation values fromton iternumbers for the element the second column contains the smallest eigenvalue for the stressed correlation matrix which is the same as the original matrix except the elements and which take values fromtothus the user can see which values for the chosen element are permitted those for which the smallest eigenvalue is positive marked green in the example the user might decide that he wants to assign the correlation which is not permitted to this particular element the smallest eigenvalue is negative then the user might have a few options all the elements of the correlation matrix will be modified so that the chosen element has the desired correlation in it but the change in the correlation matrix is the smallest possible in the sense of matrix norm this is my next step to do for this spreadsheetjust one column and the corresponding row of course will change while the rest of the matrix will stay unchanged kevin s suggestion in this case the user have to choose which column and row he prefers to modify in my examplecolumnrowor columnrowwe can discuss this approach with risk control and see how they like it i send you only the spreadsheet with an example now tanya
