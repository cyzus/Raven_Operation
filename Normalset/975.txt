 Hi To complete our discussion on the manual monitoring also to clarify see below Greg Whiting will call ENA whenever he enters more than a specified number of changes in the SAP T table He will transition this procedure to the SAP COE What is the threshold that Global needs to be notifiedWho in Global should be notifiedTo clarify the verification is manual is subject to human error such as someone forgets or is on vacation If a large file is sent without notification during the day the impact is significant I think moving the job to run in the evening will virtually eliminate the potential for this problem to occur again However to eliminate the risk completely I suggest that the verification be automated You said that you ll have the ability to do this in global in a few months If you can t do it then we SAP need to write an automated monitoring program Regan M Smith ECTAM ToJeff Johnson Corp Enron Enron Scott Mills HOU ECT ECT Beth Perlman HOU ECT ECT Sally Beck HOU ECT ECT Mark Schmidt Corp Enron ENRON Randy Rippentrop Corp Enron ENRON ccBeverly Fennessy Corp Enron ENRON Susan S Marshall HOU ECT ECT Mark J Leskowitz HOU ECT ECT Theresa Shieh Corp Enron ENRON Louie Truong GPGFIN Enron ENRON Richard Elwood HOU ECT ECT Kenneth M Harmon HOU ECT ECT Jeff Johnson Corp Enron Enron Scott Williamson HOU ECT ECT Jun Lu HOU ECT ECT Simon Sear Corp Enron Enron Kevin T Dinh HOU ECT ECT Dave Nommensen HOU ECT ECT Terry Sanvido Corp Enron ENRON Pamela Lebrane Corp Enron ENRON Chris Schomer Corp Enron ENRON Bill D Hare HOU ECT ect Lana Yu HOU ECT ECT Jaikishore Bharathi HOU ECT ECT Jim Ogg HOU ECT ECT SubjectSAP Global Unify replication problem on Friday June th On Friday June th Unify s production performance was impacted by a large volume k of replication configuration transactions from SAP The mass update from SAP to Global Unify effected Enron s business throughout the afternoon causing contract replication to be delayed and missed nominations Corrective actions taken to ensure this does not occur againGlobal ReplicationMove the SAP to Global Unify replication for Intercompany from hourly to a nightly am process As we could miss new data setup dependencies the volume is expected to be reduced SAP SupportSAP IT support will notify Global systems of any scheduled rebuilds mass updates to monitor move the schedule during an offpeak time Regan Smith x Manager Unify Accounting Unify SAP Interface
