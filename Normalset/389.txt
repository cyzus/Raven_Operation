 As you know now that we are nearly done in capturing the DPR numbers in the database we have been working to present the data in compelling ways We have started to do this by creating the VaR Limit Usage graphs and the Sharpe Rovar and RiskReturn graphs I am sorry for the misunderstanding with Ted concerning the latter I had explained what I wanted to produce in an email and during a Risk Forum Luncheon Therefore Shona and I did not expect the reaction we got I have talked to Naveen and Rudi since then and we have changed the graphs to be agreeable to RAC Today I worked on the graphs below They show the P L decomposition for the month rollingbusiness days up to one in dollar terms and the other as a percentage of P L I showed them to Shona and she thought you should see them before Naveen Rudi and Ted because these graphs are very powerful and are likely to be controversial The graphs show that European Gas and UK Power released a lot of prudency Half of total P L for European Gas is prudency and UK Power would have had a loss of aboutmillion instead of a gain ofmillion were it not for prudency In the case of North American Gasmillion gain in new deals partly offset aboutmillion in trading losses Please note that these are rough drafts intended to show what we can do I do not think that there are problems with the data but I threw these together today and I have not yet doublechecked the accuracy of my aggregating calculations Please launch the attached spreadsheet and feel free to call or page me with questions or concerns Thank you Eugenio
