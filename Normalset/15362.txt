and asked the godbolecommittee to renegotiate the committee has been given a months time torenegotiate on behalf of the state government with dpc for a new ppa the committee has opined that since the lng facility ofmmpta is far inexcess of what is required by the plant only mmpta of which mmpta ison take or pay it should be separated into a distinct facility whosecapital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge not as take or pay it should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the powergeneration using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high plf instead the surplus gas can be sold to other players like petronet or enrons own metgas it is important to distribute the cost over the entirecapacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant says thecommittee similarly it has been suggested that enron could lease out theharbour facilities as a common facility to other lng importers on the lngcontract negotiated by enron for longterm supplies it has said that sincethe lng market has witnessed great changes particularly as far as prices areconcerned the power company should take advantage of spot buys andrenegotiate the contract
