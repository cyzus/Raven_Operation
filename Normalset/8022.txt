 louise i spoke with ben and he and i are in agreement we would be prepared to take the mitsubishis into the ea turbine portfolio at cost because they are offbalance sheet and interest gets capitalized we think it makes sense to take a quarterly reserve approximating the actual interest charges in the event a turbine is flipped east west and south share in the total gain we could establish upfront a transfer price say cost mm for transfers into a project with everyone sharing in the pain and the gain we should be able to make the optimal decision for ea if brett is concerned about losing them neither ben nor i have anything that could definitively place these machines in the next month or two we both have projects leads etc but nothing can get inked quickly however it is probably in enron s interest to have people looking for alternative uses while brett is trying to firm up his deal inmonths we should have a defintive plan for these machinesif we waitmonths for brett to continue we may not have a definitive plan formonths regards chris
