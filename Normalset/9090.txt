and the utilitiescosts to run their own generation plants costs of bilateral and qualifying facility contracts and the costs of ancillary services the cdwr share of retail rates is referred to as the california purchase adjustment cpa it is not clear whether the cpa will cover wholesale power market costs current prices for multiyear power contracts may lie above the cpa in addition if investors believe that the cpa is inadequate to cover costs the entire program may be abandoned new bonds bonds will be issued to secure power the total amount of bonds issued may not exceed four times the cpa the state will transfermillion from the general fund to jumpstart the program which begins immediately this seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by cdwr from the california utilitiescustomers and municipal utilities if they opt in new residential rate freeze the california public utilities commission cpuc is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it has completed paying all outstanding obligations this locks in the recentpercent residential rate increase indefinitely governor gray davis thus keeps his pledge not to increase rates further retail competition to help secure a stable payment stream for the newbonds abenables the cpuc to prohibit the utilitiesretail customers fromchoosing an alternative electricity provider until cdwrs obligations are paid although the cpuc has yet to act on this the action would effectively halt the competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the cdwr program taxpayer protection abdirects that the new bonds clearly state; n ;either the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of california ispledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond thus the bonds are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates no assets affected the cdwr is granted neither ownership nor control of utility assets ironically the authority now granted cdwr is what california utilities had essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity prices by executing a portfolio of transactions the utilities were never provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts in addition the utilities have more experience to perform this function than cdwr rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices california has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing function sce and pg e are still left to contend with uncollected costs from past energy purchases although they will no longer incur costs associatedwith buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail rates the utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved it is not clear whether the laws prohibition on rate increases forresidential customers can be achieved the law is silent on rate increases for commercial and industrial customers providing a potential path for recoveringhigherthan expected costs alternatively cdwr could conceivably find contracts of sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met these contracts would lock in todays retail rates for a long period of time abis just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the power system in california to a more stable footing key tasks remain californias wholesale market structure which helped cause the supplycrisis by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in california remains unchanged the term contracts cdwr is likely to sign will provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but willnot be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities inaddition californias siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged the state must still address the need to expedite the development of new power plants abdoes not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale energy costs of californias utilities the state has been negotiating a deal withthe utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission assetsto the state however the utilities have achieved recent court victories thatmay pave the way to a courtdirected recovery of these costs recent audits indicate that sce and pg e recovered their stranded costs early inwhich should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes a legalshowdown between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable end follow above url for full report come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek shooting the rapidsstrategies and risks for the energy future in houston february for more information and to register please visit httpwww cera com ceraweek email categoryalert cera knowledge area s western energy to make changes to your cera com account go tohttpwww cera com client updateaccount forgot your username and passwordgo tohttpwww cera com client forgot this electronic message and attachments if any contain information from cambridge energy research associates inc cera which is confidential and may be privileged unauthorized disclosure copying distribution or use of the contents of this message or any attachments in whole or in part is strictly prohibited terms of usehttpwww cera com tos questions commentswebmaster cera com copyrightcambridge energy research associates
