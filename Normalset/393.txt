 In December we entered two swaps on Enron stock to hedge out the exposure we created by granting options We consider them trading securities so I have included them in the spreadsheet accordingly Gail Tholen explained to me that we have long term contracts to remove the variability of revenues in Bammel Looper and Mid Texas I have changed the total return swap model to use the volatility of prices inwhen the contracts expire rather than spot volatilities As a result December VaR for total return swaps fell fromtomillion With the partly offsetting effects of the new Enron stock and total return swaps December VaR for trading securities therefore fell fromtomillion I recalculated total return swap VaR for the rest ofusing volatilities forNevertheless the impact is small since spot volatilities were not as high throughout the year as in December As a matter of fact the average high and low trading securities VaRs forremain largely unchanged Regards Eugenio
