 john we finished the versionof the simulation model which deals with the openclose trading versus the continuous trading in the previous version i added the cummulative p l as an output there are a few apparent trading strategies from this model higher bid offer spread more profitmore daily of trades more profitsmaller net open positions allowed more profitandare obvious butis more interesting it means that we are better off if we do not allowed net open positions at end of the day in a trending market this makes an intuitive sense for example in the case of bull market we are short as a market maker and we can avoid the loss at the higher openning price by keeping zero or small net short positions i have attached the model with this mail and i ll be happy to discuss the model in more details with you zimin
