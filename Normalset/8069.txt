 per our discussion this morning below is a summary of items to discuss with glynnadding enron s negative ctc claim to the list of claimspge s filing included a list of top twenty creditors our negative ctc claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list the list is nonbinding however pg e will be required to file schedules of creditors on aprilour negative ctc claim should be on schedule f for unsecured claims you may want to remind glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative ctc claim will appear preferably as uncontested in the aprilfiling noteif pg e does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim including enron on the creditors committeepg e may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors committees there are several reasons to suggest to glynn that we be included we are a big creditorwe could be helpful in crafting a broader solution andwe are one of the real parties in interest behind the px and iso who were listed as significant creditors but are really just passthroughs for the suppliers and pg e likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway
