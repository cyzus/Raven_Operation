 barbara i think you make valid points in your email the latest design you sent me looks fine and meets with our approval thanks marge barbara ostdiekostdiek rice eduon pm tomarge nadaskymarge nadasky enron comccsubjectreseminar series mug at pm you wrote barbara vince kaminski had forwarded me the artwork for the mug beingworked onfor the seminar series for review comment we in public relations werewondering if you might be able to incorporate the enron logo in the design could you please contact me and advise if this is possiblewe tried to use both the enron logo and the rice university seal it just didn t work there seemed to be a few problems the first was coloras is the mug will be black with metallic gold text; introducing the other colors was distracting our admissions department uses a black and gold mug that is quite stunning and it seems to go with finance that was my motivation the second problem was that the logos themselves even if it made sense to do them in gold made the design too busya lot of the appeal in these word mugs is the clean linear look finally i think lack of company and competing business school logos increases the chances that the academics who come to present their work at our workshop will display this mug on their desk or on their shelves i think the mug will look quite stunning and i think the display of finance terms will make it an interesting conversion piecei ve never seen anything like it in academics let alone in finance i think enron s sponsorship of the seminar series will get noticed when people follow their interest in the mugs to say what is thiswhere d this come fromi m hoping this version will be acceptable to you for our first shot at this please advise barbara ostdiek
