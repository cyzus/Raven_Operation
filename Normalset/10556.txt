 notethe ferc meeting is today see the link below that can be checked for updates enron s lay urges bold solutions to power market woes as the federal energy regulatory commission prepared to weigh in this morning with the federal government s answer to california s bedeviled power market free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price cap route espoused by the caliso ferc s meeting is scheduled to start atam est check httpintelligencepress com this morning for updates in a letter fired off to ferc chairman james j hoecker yesterday enron ceo kenneth lay urged the commission to find a fix for the underlying structural problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers who have placed price cap band aids over hemorrhaging wounds lay told hoecker the power market is halfway across a busy street in its transition from monopoly to competition it can t stand where it is he said ferc has to make a choice between falling into the same trap of political expediency as california s iso leaving the nation s electric system in the lurch from one crisis to the next [o]r it can take a big step toward fundamental structural reform at the same time the electric power supply association epsa called on ferc to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the caliso from unilaterally implementing any changes to its currentmwh price cap for wholesale electricity purchases in a motion filed monday the marketer group specifically asked the commission to bar the caliso board of directors from putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex loaddifferentiated price cap ofor less during the offpeak season effective novthe plan was designed by the state s main utility consumer group see daily gpi octin addition the epsa urged ferc to state explicitly that the caliso does not have the authority to impose or extend price or bid caps unless expressly authorized to do so by the commission the caliso s current authority to set price caps expires on novlay said the caliso s complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of gasfired generation making obvious errors such as failing to take into account gas transportation costs between the henry hub and power plants in california; in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to sell their gas supply rather than use it to make electricity in california the new formula also forces the iso into the market to buy power on an ad hoc basis to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract sufficient supplies which it inevitably will do lay said in addition the capped formula invites generators to shut in production export power out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries he noted that the iso s chairman voted against the measure while all of the state s utilities voted for it presumably knowing full well that it simply will not work california is just the latest failure of partial or compromised open access said lay it s time for the commission to reject this approach the power industrythe nation s most essential industryis mired in the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one vested interest or another as a result utilities are free to slow the interconnection of new generation withhold equal access to the transmission system favor their own sales over those of competitors miscalculated available transmission capacity and exercise control over supposedly independent system operators and reliability organizations lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and conservation methods ferc has to complete the work that it started said lay it has to ensure that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by ending the special priority for utility uses of the system second ferc must require transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets from their other businesses third ferc must take politics out of transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure independence finally ferc must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies epsa said the caliso board acted in obvious disregard for the commission s orderly processes it cannot be permitted to make the commission s decisions for it or to alter so radically market rules thereby injecting more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for fashioning fair effective and comprehensive remedies for california s flawed electric markets the group noted the epsa believes that any remedial actions taken by ferc with respect to the california markets will be severely compromised if the caliso board s imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect
