williams iii bill nonprivileged pst i have obtained a copy of a letter from representative tauzin and others to ferc chairman hebert which appears below it could provide some indication of the direction ferc will take with the order it plans to issue next monday summarizing the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire wscc which plan shouldprohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements; refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan adopt market mechanisms rather than imposing rigid price controls and allow recovery of all verifiable costs promote conservation and demand response please see details below june the honorable curt hbert jr chairman federal energy regulatory commissionfirst street ne washington dcdear chairman h bertsince last summer the committee on energy and commerce has closely monitored the electricity situation in california today the west continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century and california faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again this summer after extensive review of the energy crisis in the west including several hearings in washington and california we recommend that the commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into california we recognize the commission s efforts in recent months to address the electricity crisis in the california and western markets including measures to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices while we are pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout the west we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in california and the entire west in the hot summer months to come to ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months ahead we believe the commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices in western markets we strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market participants within the entire western systems coordinating council wscc specifically such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the wscc the plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and failures to comply with agreements to sell power if the commission finds that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan it should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law aware of the danger of discouraging supply the commission has relied upon marketoriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts we share the commission s concerns regarding the need to encourage supply accordingly to prevent blackouts and contribute to a longterm solution the commission s comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission to mitigate prices and increase available supply we also urge the commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote conservation and demand response throughout the western market in states where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs consumers have less incentive to conserve while demand reduction incentives are not a substitute for accurate price signals a demand response program can encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both wholesale and retail consumers to sell at market or other incentive prices foregone electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume specifically the commission should establish or certify a wholesale clearinghouse for demand reduction agreements; andenable consumers whether individually or through aggregation arrangements to sell foregone power to their own local distribution utility or to thirdparty purchasers we recognize that individual states and utilities are implementing demand reduction programs but a broader regional solution is needed to enable sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer we understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting state laws abrogating existing contracts or shifting costs to nonparticipant consumers we look forward to working with you to build upon the commission s previous efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for consumers in california and the west this summer and thereafter to ensure maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead we request that you take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as possible we request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not later than the close of business on friday juneif you have questions please contact our staff thank you in advance for your cooperation with this request sincerely w j billy tauzin chairman committee on energy and commerce joe barton chairman subcommittee on energy and air quality heather wilson member committee on energy and commerce george radanovich member committee on energy and commerce mary bono member committee on energy and commerce greg walden member committee on energy and commerce william m thomas jerry lewis duncan hunter randy duke cunningham ken calvert stephen horn edward r royce doug ose darrell e issa
