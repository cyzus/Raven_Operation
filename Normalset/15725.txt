 vincehere is an explanation of what amonth package for anjam actually entails it seems to me that anjam s interest in getting an expat package is mostly about money based on the uk hr s read of anjam they think he will jump i have a telephone conference with anjam at my stance will beis firm we will help with the transition via a one time settlementflat rental issues lbs of air shipping for moving furniture maybe one trip back to uk a year but no more rehis concerns of having a place in london should he want to return i will say that vince would be far better at finding a good spot for you than any hr type so that part of the package promise is not particularly important any guidelines for me to follow coachregards grantforwarded by grant masson hou ect onamtara rozenam togrant masson hou ect ect ccmelanie doyle lon ect ect jane allen hou ect ect subjectrehouston research opportunity grant not sure if i told you that i work mon wed friday hence the delay in responding sorry if i forgot to tell you another contact name in my absence who will be able to assist is jane allen in houston cc ed above three main reasons we try to stay away from assignments to the us for this type level of transfer are costequitability among other peersdifficulty in transferring employee to local package from assignment package however if this is truly amonth assignment with no intention of extension we would normally do the following month assignment london base car allowance and benefits and national insurance contribution costs currently of all comp compared with of all comp plus up to max of k of employers us contribution housing costs in houston paid if maintaining housing in the uk usually up toper month for single utility costs if maintaining a house in the ukup toper month home leavetwo economy trips per year is standard transportation to from assignmenteconomy class transportation in houstonwe normally give thisup toper day for rental car in addition to the person s car allowance as they normally do not require a car in the uk and take the car allowance as a cash benefit whereas they will require a car in houston shipment of goodslbs air tax assistance disturbance allowancenormally pay approxso in terms of costs if you just compare a local us salary of manager on k to a local uk manager on ok the us total cost is approx k the uk cost is approx k then if you add the above costs to the assignment you will see an even greater increase in cost compared with the local peers ie approx k compared with k we do have the ability to change the above in any way as there is no set policy; however anjam has already brought up other people s assignments and i have a feeling he will do his best to find out what everyone else is receiving if we make clear though that we are keeping on uk payroll but not providing any assignment type allowances just in order for him to maintain his pension contributions for the year and at which point a decision will need to be made returns or moves to local us then we may be able keep more consistency with your group while maintaining more reasonable costs not sure how you want to play this though even if he does go on assignment rather than transfer locally there is still the issue of whether or not a suitable job will be here at the end of themonths we will always do our best to find suitable postions but we cannot guarantee it if he transfers to a local us contract enron europe s responsibility of finding suitable employment is pretty much nil i hope this has made things clearer rather than more complicated i honestly feel that ajnam will absolutely not take this position if it is not on an assignment basis he made it pretty clear that unless he could stay on uk payroll formonths he would not transfer call me if you would like to discuss tara x enron capital trade resources corp fromgrant massontotara rozen lon ect ect ccsubjectrehouston research opportunity tarathanks for the update it seems anjam is playing hard ball a little my initial reaction is to be inflexible because it is a good offer but on second thoughts could you please give me an idea of what is meant by a month assignment when you have a momentcompensation benefits responsibilities career path implications etc many thanks regards grant
