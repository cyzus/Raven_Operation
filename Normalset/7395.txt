 wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each the outline that i sent you with the changes for the remainder of thisweek is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set the schedule that we have been working with that wes provided did not allocate two hours for the friday meeting if you had set aside two hours that had not been communicated to us there were only two onehour meeting slots on that schedule one for enw fromand one for research fromi havea major conflict on fridayi committed months ago to attend a meeting that ken lay asked to be involved in that is in the woodlands that runs through the evening hours only because beth perlman is out on thursday for a religious holiday i decided to skip out from this meeting to be here on friday afternoon to discuss the operations and it development budgets together in order to minimize my time away from the woodlands meeting i orchestrated the time swap with vince kaminiski so that we could have our enw meeting at i will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for ken lay maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us i would appreciate your help on that louise scheduling issues aside wes suggested that we also review with you the eesbudget that enw has prepared our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend forfor expense and capital for allof the services that enw provides to support the ees business we have done this without regard to who will cover which expensesees or ea that is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs we are prepared however with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes i have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for ees and enw if you would like to cover all of enw s budgets together both for ees and ea then it would make more sense to set a longerblock of time maybehoursi will bring my schedule to our meeting at today to cover the canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us we will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you thecomponents of costs and the detail of capital projects our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our scope of engagement discussion a service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement we will have a straw man for discussion on that sallyoriginal message from kitchen louise sent wednesday september am to beck sally cc piper greg; pickering mark; colwell wes; killen faith; roper kerry; schoppe tammie; valdez christina subject reregrouping of enw budget discussionsi am expecting an all in cost for this servicewhat do we achieve in separation i had allocated two hours on friday to do this from pm until pm are you not intending an all in cost per transaction of it and operationsif you believe that the outline below works then go ahead do we justhave the total number debate on fridyif so let s start at pm thanks louise original message from beck sally sent tuesday september pm to kitchen louise cc piper greg; pickering mark; colwell wes; killen faith; roper kerry; schoppe tammie; valdez christina subject regrouping of enw budget discussionslouise to make our enw budget discussions most meaningful we felt that coupling discussions of the operations and it development budgets will make the most sense to insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our enwplan meetings and to schedule these meetings around thursday as a religious holiday i have worked with wes colwell and made a trade with vince kaminski to make all of this happen there is no change to your calendar in termsof date time or location of meetings we have simply realigned topics and attendees as followsdate timelocation revised group revised attendeeswednoon ebcanada support unchangedwes colwell faith killen louisekitchen sally beck rob milnthropbob hall addedresponsible for eaoperations including calgary thursebenweol infrastructure wes colwell faith killen louisekitchen sally beck mark pickeringjenny rub greg piper kerry roperbrad richter addedeol jay webb addedeol fripmebresearch wes colwell faithkillen louisekitchen vince kaminiski no changespmebenwoperations it devwes colwell faith killen louise kitchen sally beck beth perlmanmark pickering greg piper kerryroper bob hall addedea operations i look forward to reviewing details with you in each of these meetings sally
