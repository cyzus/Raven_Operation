 Sally Thanks for the email regarding summer interns I apologize that Lexi andShelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking I wishthat you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havingdifficulty I have personally assured you on several occasions that I wasavailable to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason anymember of my staff was not responsive That being said please allow me toexplain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set it You are absolutely correct It is great to do market research if timepermits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge Asyou are aware over the past year we have engaged a professional recruitingfirm Brecker Merryman who has assisted us in a number of different marketresearch projects However in my opinion this issue is not one thatrequired much research I have been involved in recruiting in some way shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past years Most major organizations with the exception of the Accounting firms begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring There areactually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer internsuntil after a certain date particularly in the MBA programs For example Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to firstyear students until January As indicated the firms that generally recruitin the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting forspring internships The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was lastyear with respect to summer interns Presentations were made in January February and offers were made in February and March The only school thatdid not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George HopeWe did of course recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax groupbecause they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enrons ability to hire quality summerinterns This past summer Enron hadsummer Analysts undergraduate and summer Associates graduate We intentionally limited the number ofsummer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningfulassignments Approximatelyof these individuals received permanentoffers to join Enron The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduatesummer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hireundergraduates for summer positions They generally focus on MBAs particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firmsthat Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron s competitors Because theundergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we havecontinued to have a special focus on these individuals i e the reason therewereundergraduates and onlyMBAs With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools aboutwhich you raised a concern let me address your concerns In your email youindicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU You did not however provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spokentherefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU While OU has not gotten back to her following is the information obtainedfrom UT o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson o According to Cindy approximatelyof companies actively recruiting oncampus conduct interviews in the fall for summer internships Cindyattributes this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the springor in the case of Andersen Consulting have a tremendous need and conductall interviews at one time o In conclusion Cindy estimated thatof companies actively recruiting oncampus recruit in the spring for summer internships We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide thestatistics at this time I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of suchinformation It appears that the information your source obtained is considerablydifferent than what we were told If you would provide the name of theindividual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason forthe discrepancies While I understand your concern with respect to OU they appear to bedifferent than most of the other schools at which we recruit If you believethat it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we aresupportive; however because Lexi has other school interviews that arealready scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interviewprocess during the trip you have scheduled currently As you are aware inmost instances the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated bythe respective universities and were secured in early August If you wouldlike for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date thisfall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule tosupport your efforts I hope this has been helpful I can understand and appreciate yourfrustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or hermanager Again I offer that I am available and willing to work with you ifyou are having difficulty with members of the Program staff Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summerinterns and whether I can be of any additional assistance Charlene
