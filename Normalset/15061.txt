 john we can approach this problem this way basically you are asking how the total varianceare distributed amongdays and the lastdays assuming volatility for the first period is simga and that in thelast days is sigma thensigmasigmafuthermore we can use nov implied volatility as a proxy to sigma then we can calculate sigma which is the volatility for dec contract in the lastdays sigam sqrt sigma make sense zimin john disturnalpm tozimin lu hou ect ect ccsubjectvol rollup zimin i am trying to understand what the near winter ng implied vols will look like as they approach expiration for example is it possible to infer what the implied volatility of the dec ng contract will look like withdays to expiry given we know current voland term to maturitydays
