mcgowan et s enron enron ccsubjectsave the dateaugustplease plan to attend an inhouse training session on an introduction to the electric industry jim crist a lecturer with igt is preparing a daylong seminar customized to our interests and issues here is my toplist on why gpg staff need to increase our understanding of the electric industry first and foremost gasfired electric generation is the growth market for gas pipelines we need to get a sense of why and where generation is being built and who the likely customers are this involves understanding the different between utility generation and merchant plants the dynamics of siting understanding a little bit about how utilities plan and economically justify generation investments second we need to understand electric utilities as customers who is the customer these daysthe generatorwho should we be dealing with within the utility organization what types of load patterns should we expect various types of electric playerswhat types of services do they needwe also need to get a sense of how the timing of their processes compare contrast to our processes on the gas side third we need to understand the regulatory climate on the electric side and the implications for electric generation demand growth we need to understand the state federal jurisdictional issues we need to learn about the debates over atc tlr locational marginal pricing price caps and control areas we need to understand how these issues fit into enron s position in support of restructuring the electric industry unbundling transmission removing native load exceptions and avoiding prices caps and we need to understand how these debates affect gpg fourth we need to understand electric tariffs and practices services and oasis because the ferc has started to insist on common rules between gas and electric the recent electric interconnection policy has now been applied on the gas side ferc is talking about imposing the rto principles on pipelines and we hear a lot of comparisons between oasis and pipeline ebbs we want to learn how to take advantage of electric best practices where it makes sense and on the flip side know how to argue against the imposition of electric rules on our pipelines where there are legitimate differences between gas and electric i ve shared this list of interests with jim crist as he prepares a customized seminar for us please feel free to email me with any other areas of interest for the course i will keep you posted on the specific location as things progress in the meantime please make sure to save the date please pass this notice along to others in your organization that may be interested
