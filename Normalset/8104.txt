 john and louisebased on your meeting with kevin and dave earlier today i understand you would like a breakdown of the expenditures expected to develop a texas coal plant to the point that it can be monetized the below is my best estimate for developing the brownsville site to get to the monetization point permits in hand and epc contract signed i expect to have both an epc contract and permits in hand some time around sepif we start with the expenditures in mid julyexpenditures will be incurred at the rate of approximately per month for the nextmonths we can back out at any time with only prompt month plus one additional month committed costs for a florida site will be similar; however expenditures will not start until we achieve site control my recommendation is to start fully developing the brownsville tx site with a plan to flip the site once we have a permit as market conditions warrant i recommend holding off on significant expenditures in florida until we get more comfortable with site control mitch bys option for land leaseepc contractor preliminary engineeringowner s engineer permit filingconsultant etcdetailed engineering fuel transport study contractgeotech studiestotal
