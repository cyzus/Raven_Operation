 christine see the attached i ve changed paragraphto be like our last posting and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery but omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time my only other comment is that i think the group needs to discuss beforehand how a shipper s request for alternate points is going to be treated as currently drafted this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate which calls into question our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount if we do intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt points at a discounted rate we should take this statement out end of paragraphif we re still living in a max rate world though this really is not much of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max rate any questionsgive me a call s christine stokesam tosusan scott et s enron enron ccsubjecttw ios posting susan please review the following ios posting thanks
