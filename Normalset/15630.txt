 dear all attached is anjam s reasoning and final version of the uk ppi pllu model the uk inflation book s main exposure is to two ppi indexesthe pllu and the dzcv through yearboth are ppi output indexes with very comparable baskets the only significant difference between the two is the presence of energy in the pllu the model in use escalates the two indexes by the same factors however with the energy price fluctuations in recent years different models for the two indexes would reflect better the nature of their drivers anjam concentrated on the pllu index first and he will shortly construct one for the dzcv based on the same methodology but without the brent crude curve the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curveit is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one and it is considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients this will result in us having more confidence in our monthly p l as well as less fluctuations best regards martina x anjam ahmadtomartina angelova lon ect ect ccsubjectnew update on ppi model for inflation book dear all i followed up on the suggestions of happening babe at the conference call as follows use less data unfortunately kicking out onlymakes the overall equation a lot less robust in fact dramatically so and so eliminates the possibility of using less data the model tested was the rpi monthdeviations from longterm average for brent crude the rsquared and fstatistic collapsed by eliminating the firstmonths of datadeviations in crude variable shifting the crude explanatory variable backwards and forward byandmonths did not alter the model goodnessoffit parameters dramatically and so my suggestion is that we stick with the following modelpllu[t] a rpi[t] b rpi[t ] c brentcrudedeviations[t] constanttesting model with sine wave to gauge the response of the model to wildlyvarying rpi forward curve a sine wave of periodyears for rpi was input into the ppi model the result was as expected; ppi preempts the moves in rpi by aboutmonths the magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced this shows that if we had more detail in our rpi forward curve then the ppi model would reflect those peaks and humps adequately conclusion i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi rpi[t ] and deviations of brent crude from longterm average the new model is plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue please note that all this analysis only applies to pllu and that a separate study will be needed for the dzcv ppi index regards anjam xforwarded by anjam ahmad lon ect on anjam ahmadtomartina angelova lon ect ect harry arora hou ect ect maureen raymond hou ect ect zimin lu hou ect ect farouk lalji hou ect ect cctrena mcfarland lon ect ect dale surbey lon ect ect stinson gibner hou ect ect vince j kaminski hou ect ect leandro ibasco corp enron enron subjectupdate on ppi model for inflation book dear all we thought it might be useful to incorporate brent crude as an explanatory variable for ppi; it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the longterm average of was the best form of the variable to use for predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is used the three new equations developed werepllu t a rpi t b rpi t n c datedbrentcrudeconstant where n is or[reddish curves] rsquared approx fstat approxthe chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this equation and also the three best relations from before which were based upon current and future rpipllu t a rpi t b rpi t n constant where n is or[greenish curves] rsquared approx fstat approxcomparison of models as you can see the two equations differ in the very shortterm and very longterm; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to shortterm predictions of to over the next six months the greenish curves predict pllu in the range of to over the next six months the curves are then very similar untilwhen the models including crude breakaway to the upside relative to the falling rpi curve the model based purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term this is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyondwhich we don t suggestion what could be useful now is a differentlyspecified model designed to forecast only the nextmonths using autoregressive or autoregressive error terms this model would be far more accurate in the nearterm and we could include this information onto the front of this longterm model this may be useful despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time buckets backtesting all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data sample used based mainly on s new paradigm economy hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the teleconference; your ideas on this would be appreciated regards anjam x
