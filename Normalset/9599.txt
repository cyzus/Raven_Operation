 attached is the latest draft of the transport option program filing there are a couple of important changes from the last draft one is that we re no longer stating that the option fee is going to be marketbased at ferc the term marketbased has connotations of having to prove to ferc that a noncostbased rate is appropriate because we lack market power while we probably do lack market power the consensus of the legal regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a builtin feature of the transport rate which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee if this theory is not clear to you after you read the filing letter let s discuss how it should be improved the other significant change also based on my meeting with legal regulatory is that i ve structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper regardless of whether they currently use transport on tw will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option in other words a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a maxdtq of zero this structure has two advantagesit s consistent with our optionfeeaspartoftransportrate theory andit will help support that theory in our next rate case i d like to meet next week either wednesday afternoon or thursday to discuss the following topicsyour comments and questions on this draftsome examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpointthe bidding process and how bids for options will be evaluated andcomments received from shippers thus far i ll be working ontomorrow; let s talk about what would be a good meeting time i will be out mon and tues
