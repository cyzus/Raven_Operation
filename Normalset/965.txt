 We have pursued implementing Unify in London however there are a number of issues preventing that from happening in the near futureThe Unify IT team has a lot of competing priorities including the Houston SAP implementation as well as Houston and Calgary changes and enahncements and are unable to commit to a firm implementation date at this time New commitments by ENA see mail at bottom have further complicated the priorities so even the tentative plans for implementing Unify in London this year are in doubt On the IT side there are a number of issues with support and scalability of the current architecture of the system As it doesn t look like Unify can be implemented in London this year we will therefore change focus to streamlining the existing tactical solutions in London enhancing Back Office Settlements System integrating with Global CounterParties removing London Office Manager and using SAP where appropriate Once Unify has been integrated with SAP in Houston we will in a better position to consider the longterm strategic approach to Unify in London If anyone believes that we should take a different response please respond to this email Eric Ian Richard Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp FromFernley DysonToRichard Sage LON ECT ECT ccStephen P Schwarz HOU ECT ECT Richard Burchfield HOU ECT ECT Eric Virro LON ECT ECT David J Williams LON ECT ECT Ian Sloman LON ECT ECT Beth S Perlman LON ECT ECT SubjectReUnify We need to discuss the details but to my mind the question has to be why wouldn t we do itRichard SageToFernley Dyson LON ECT ECT Stephen P Schwarz HOU ECT ECT Richard Burchfield HOU ECT ECT ccEric Virro LON ECT ECT David J Williams LON ECT ECT Ian Sloman LON ECT ECT Beth S Perlman LON ECT ECT SubjectUnify Putting Unify in London is not something that is going to happen tomorrow If we are going to do it we need to do it right Shall we go ahead with thisEnron Information Technology FromInja ChunToRichard Sage LON ECT ECT Phil Yoxall LON ECT ECT Stephen P Schwarz HOU ECT ECT Paul F Poellinger HOU ECT ECT Ian Sloman LON ECT ECT Eric Virro LON ECT ECT Kenneth M Harmon HOU ECT ECT Regan M Smith HOU ECT ECT ccBeth Perlman LON ECT ECT Mark Pickering LON ECT ECT Philippe A Bibi HOU ECT ECT Sally Beck HOU ECT ECT SubjectRevised Unify Plan During the last few weeks we experienced significant increases in Unify transaction volumes because of Columbia Energy Services acquisition EOL and Calgary implementation For example recently the Logistics transactions increased bywhile deal meter count increased byand total volume MMBTU byIn addition it is very possible that volumes may increase by anotherdue to new acquisitions in the near future For these reasons we must put our efforts in overhauling Unify Settlement now before working on London implementation Therefore we are postponing our February out visit to London We will let you know our revised plans and targets as soon as we can Thank you
