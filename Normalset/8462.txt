 louise i understand there is concern that the value associated with the assignment of the lincoln electric sales agreement to oppd is not sufficient to justify paying million to oppd in order for them to assume this contract there are some considerations on this contract which i think are important and which may not have been mentioned to you the original sales contract to lincoln was entered into several years ago and is one of the contracts sometimes referred to internally as toxic wasteabout a month ago we agreed verbally with oppd to accept assignment of the sales contract as oppd is one of the few parties which can serve itthe execution of the documents has been delayed by lincoln who were initially refusing to consent to the assignmentwe have another larger underwater transaction with oppd which we would like to move off the books at some point we d like to keep oppd happy to improve the chances that we can negotiate their buyout of our other sales contract to themif we fail to deliver we will be subject to penalties in the amount of per mw on top of liquidated damages lincoln ismw forandmw for this is a highly constrained area onlycounterparties can physically deliver in this area and oppd is the only one which has the surplus power in order to serve lincoln the chance that we will be unable to deliver is highthere is intangible value associated with not being in a situation where enron fails to delivereven if we do wind up serving the contract the highly constrained nature of the area means we will likely be forced to pay extortionate prices for the power we do acquiretrading wishes to be out of this contract for aforementioned reasons and the fact that it will be very labour intensive to serve dayahead notice onmonthly load factor obviously if the above is not sufficient justification to put the money out the door now then we will smooth things as much as possible with oppdbut i wanted to make sure you had all the info before we kill the deal terri has stalled oppd until monday dave
