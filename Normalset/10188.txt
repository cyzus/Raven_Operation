 the gd article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good readersdigest version of the order susan and i spoke with jeff dasovich and markbaldwin yesterday and the consensus of those conversations was thattranswestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes ofimplementation documentation jeff offered that he might send a letter togovernor gray s office expressing both dismay and indignation that the cpucdidn t complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to californiaratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved he may ask the othercomprehensive settlement parties to join in signing the letter susan markand i spoke about this idea later and we ve got some reservations about twsrole in admonishing the cpuc we should probably wait to see this letterfirst before committing to anything bilas draft cautious toward socal competition mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state californiapublic utilities commissioner richard bilas has recommended the adoption of a much moremoderate approach to promoting competition on southern california gassocal system in his draft decision bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlingof intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case theless farreaching interim settlement is submitted in decembersocal san diego gas andelectric and other parties filed two more settlements after the is reaching acomprehensive agreement in april this year but since then gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state prompting aconsumer backlash and giving competition a bad name the draft language notes thatthe first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements recent events lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of thisinvestigation the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm tradable intrastate transmission rights should be delayed according to thedraft order this unbundling is the basis of the [comprehensive settlement]and we cannot approve it we do not however wish to commit to paralysisuntilas the [postinterim settlement] would have us do accordingly we believe californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption with modifications of the is the biggest change to the is in the draft is the rejection of an automaticcapacity expansion by socal at wheeler ridge calif with rolledin rates if certain criteriaare met el paso energy had objected to the provision in the is that would have allowed socalto automatically expand capacity at wheeler ridge bymillion cfd if a certain number ofcurtailments occurred el paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at wheelerwhen only certain customers would benefit the draft says socal can file a separate application for the wheeler ridgeexpansion but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing process the draft decision would also end socals current windowingprocess which limits shippersability tochange nominations for deliveries between receipt points on the system it is replaced with anannounced daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point;establish hector road as a formal receipt point for nominations;institute an operational flow order ofo procedure provides a forum formore changes in ofo procedures if excessive ofos are made;set up poolsof gas on the socal transmission system that are intended toincrease the liquidity of gas trading;make changes to balancing rules while retaining the currentmonthlyimbalance tolerance;make socals own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balancing rulesand penalties as all other shippers;allow some limited imbalances trading as well as the right to assign andreassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market with a socal electronic bulletinboard set up for it;unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost exceedingthat required for core minimum reliability; andprovide for rate recovery of up to million in implementation costs in addition the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation fromrates eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges eliminatethe core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs the threshold forparticipating in core aggregation is reduced and billing options are offered to coreaggregators bilasdraft also warned that the commission may come back in two years toopen another investigation into gas competition taking into account any changes in marketconditions bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draftthe cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border showing adifferential between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transportand related services; we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by marketersif more competition is allowedbilas wrote in the draft decision with half the state already committed toa restructured competitive natural gas industry it suddenly seems as if thebenefits of such re structuring to enhance competition are speculative particularly at thistime with one leg in the water the current has switched direction and it will be difficult if notfoolhardy to reach our goals by forging ahead we choose to take a cautious approach again the draft continues ratherthan proceeding to unbundle transmission in southern california now we approve withmodifications the settle ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market additionally weunbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the legislature to pass consumerprotection legisla tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in coreaggregation programs the cpuc would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission andother restruc turing in the future but believe that at this point in time the certainbenefits do not outweigh the costs to most ratepayers all drafts must be fileddays before the meetings at which they will bediscussed the draft decision is currently on the agenda for the cpucs decmeeting
