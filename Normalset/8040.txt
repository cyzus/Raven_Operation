 joe and louisei was on a conf call today re erc financing legal and finance were on the call the consensus was that it would be difficult the structure involves selling the erc s at market to an entity controlled by the bank; buying a call from that entity; selling a put to that entity; having a price swap fixed floating with entity the bank would also want to understand market liquidity price transparency and the rules of every district we have erc s in the texas sox deal recently put into this vehicle was much simpler in a more liquid market but it tookmonths and mm of legal fees to put together the lawyers involved believe that it would be more difficult and likely more expensive for the california erc swe have several districts and several products mm internal resources seems like a lot for a mm mm balance with an expected term of one yearespecially with uncertain success due to the price transparency issues no index price any thoughtschris calger
