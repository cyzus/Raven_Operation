 i have had a casual chat with some of my accounts regarding their opinion of the market dynamics affecting the needles to topock price differentials each customer focused more on the supply side dynamics of topock gas supplies rather than the incremental intrastate transport costs required to transport to the pg e citygate as the primary driving force for the needles to topock price differential here is a recurring theme i heard from my customersthe el paso merchant service epms bcf contract s block ii capacitymmcf d of permian to pg e topock capacitytransport rate has a recallable aspect if epms schedules gas under the transport of block ii capacity to any other california delivery point other than pg e topock then other parties may recall the capacity for their own use to pg e topock currently duke has recalledmmcf d and pg e energy trading has also recalledmmcf d for their use to transport permian gas to pg e topock fyiepmc may rerecall this capacity but they have elected not to these additional topock supplies coming from duke and pg e energy trading under block ii capacity may be viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to pg e at topock this gas competes head to head with malin gas prices for example today s malin price is while pg e topock price is today s cash price differential between needles and topock isfar larger than the previously assumeddifferential resulting from the intrastate cost required to bring topock gas to the citygate if anyone else had additional market information or opinions regarding these market dynamics let s discuss further at our next staff meeting cs
