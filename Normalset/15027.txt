caps the following summarizes recent price cap events in california i think that i have most of it right if there is anything wrong or missing please let me know please don t share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of enron regards tim new cap specifics onthe iso board passed a motion by a vote ofto implement a new price cap methodology the new methodology will become effectiveor as soon thereafter as can be implemented caiso staff has indicated that it will be difficult to achieve that start date they have not yet indicated what an achievable date might be the new price cap methodology will remain in place untilcomprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions either ferc or the iso board orders its removal cap prices will be based on the average nymex ld settlement average and the following heat rate tableload level heat rate gas example cap gwgw togw gw togw gw togw gwmwhmwh caps will be rounded up to the nearestmwh increment demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps the iso will post the price caps for each load level at leasthours prior to the beginning of each calendar month based on the iso s two dayahead system load forecast the iso will post hourly caps at leasthours prior to the hour of delivery ferc context ferc has delegated cap authority to the caiso untilthe iso has asserted that they don t need ferc authority since it is a bid cap rather than a sales cap ferc regulates sales not purchases of electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices the iso has filed with ferc for an extension of the price cap authority ferc has to rule on the filing bynote that this isdays after their authority expires ferc will release its proposed order onbased on the results of itsinvestigation of the california wholesale power markets we don t know what they will find or what they will propose the proposed order will have aday comment period after which ferc will likely issue a final order ferc will be accepting oral comments onin washington enron still has to determine who will provide oral comments many companies have filed at ferc advocating or opposing a litany of price caps cost based rates and market redesign recommendations it is likely that the price caps approved by the iso board will go into effect how long they will remain in effect will depend on whether ferc extends the iso price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from the currentinvestigation stipulates a specific price cap policy impact of price caps the attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at different gas price levels we think that this is the highest that markets would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap it is hard to say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap because we don t know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the cap the assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below take actual historical loads fromandcalculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load new price cap methodology and a range of gas prices divide historical hours into peak and offpeak buckets calculate average price for each month for peak hours and offpeak hours for example we have two years worth of data for the months of january through september each month has approximatelyhours for january through september we took approximatelyobservations for each monthfrom each year and calculated a simple average of all of the individual observations we created a peak table and an offpeak table the table shows the calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices for each month this value represents what the month would clear at if each hour cleared at the cap based on historic loads while any given hour could be above this value our calculation estimates the likely monthly average cap value the blue shading indicates what the caps would be given currentnymex forward prices the yellow shading indicates those forward power prices which are in excess of the proposed cap
