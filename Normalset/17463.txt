 vince just fyioliver risk control in london was asking if it is appropriate to use a set of factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity this mapping we do quite frequently in our var system when forward prices for a commodity are not correlated because of poor price history i think using this kind of mappings is ok because we can not trust these correlations based on illiquid price information if we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with ourfactorsthen we might use more factors thenor the matrix itself tanya tanya tamarchenkopm tooliver gaylard lon ect ect ccdavid port market risk corp enron enron rudi zipter hou ect ect wenyao jia hou ect ect kirstee hewitt lon ect ect debbie r brackett hou ect ect naveen andrews corp enron enron subjectreuk power gas oliver i completely agree with youvalidating var inputs like positions prices and volatilities which are used by risktrac is the first thing to do you also rise a valid questionif the factor loadings for some commodity do not make sense should we use the factor loadings for another commoditythe factor loadings do not make sense when the correlations across the term structure are not high so if we believe that the forward prices for this commodity are market prices and statistical analysis on these prices produces the correlations which we trust then it would be proper to use this correlation matrix in var engine not the factors using factors is simply the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without sacrificing the accuracy tanya oliver gaylardam tonaveen andrews corp enron enron ccdavid port market risk corp enron enron rudi zipter hou ect ect wenyao jia hou ect ect kirstee hewitt lon

be using this calculation engine for all commodity vars however we should not focus solely on the uk but ensure that we use risk trac for continental power and gas uk power and gas nordic power to use risk trac i think the following need to be resolved first to implement it right the first time as i think it is incorrect to consider the risk trac numbers as the most accurate since it depends on the validity of these itemspositions delta and gamma and curve mappingthese need to include all positions including those outside the main risk systems positions curves and mapping should now be no problem given the feeds apart from continental power have been uat d and we have the spreadsheet feeds up and running price and vol curvesas used by the risk systems as above inter commodity correlationprompt month correlation should be easy to calculate given an accurate and complete data set however the incomplete historic data for europe in risk trac prior to the formation of the task force would mean a full data set needs to be obtained and used term structure of correlation would be good but i understand this is difficult to use in the calculation factor loadings i think factor loadings should be calculated on the same data sets used for inter commodity correlation for all commodities if this analysis does not appear to work i am not sure that using factor loadings for other markets is adequate do we need to consider an alternative approach to calculating var for these marketsto ensure this moves forward i think a list of the mile stones responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up otherwise i fear the process of moving across to risk trac from the spreadsheet var will experience some slippage i will call today to start the process off rgds oliver naveen

ramesh hou ect ect debbie r brackett hou ect ect subjectuk power gas oliver i had a couple of issues pertaining to uk power uk gas first just a few notes as it pertains to risk trac ukimplementation in risktrac currently all the gas curves are mapped to nbpall the power curves are mapped to r cinergy factor loading analysis lends itself only to nbp and the norewgian curves for reasons of liquidity etc we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the best curves available at this time the spreadsheet which is utilized in the uk also has curves mapped to a year old set of factors derived from us nat gas which is clearly not optimal hencewe should be using risktrac numbers for var as it is the most accurate both in terms of enewide model usage and in terms of the most recent updated data ever since uk power came on board in risktracweeks ago the uk power number has been consistently mm above the numbers in your spreadsheet this difference is to be ecpected given the different inputsthe consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way however if you believe that positions are not captured correctly please let our it staff know thatchecks which ramesh has done indicate that positions are tying in however as you know there could be disconnects with enpower etc in any event it would be ideal and optimal to have all the simulations run out of risktrac for reasons of aggregation and analysis your help is appreciated regards naveen
