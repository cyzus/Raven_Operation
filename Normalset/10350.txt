 caithnessconfidentiality agreements were sent this week to the project developers of the mw big sandy project in northwest arizona work continues on developing pipe lateral costs and environmental impact statements kn energytheir current transport contract to the west has a rofr that expires the mmbtu d capacity is split evenly between topock and needles kn is not currently flowing anything to topock at a rate ofmmbtu even with the topock space the total capacity could be worth something in the low to mids kn would also like to keep the rofr language but this could only occur with a max rate deal for a term of one year or longer we should have any offer from kn by monday operationswe temporarily lost a compressor for approximatelyhour at stationon thursday there was minimal throughput impacted an unusual knock sound has also been coming from one of the units at stationhigh western flow is taking its toll on equipment august capacitywest demand is expected to be robust for august higher than june with high temperatures combined with lower hydrogeneration capacity available from the northwest per cera el paso blanco mismeasurementa letter was drafted this week for stan s signature for delivery to el paso s management the letter outlines the circumstances and chronology of events leading up to our meeting with el paso in june the letter requests a payback of all the gas volume stan has opted not attach a copy of the lawsuit filing to the letter reliantextended their flex firm primary receipt and primary delivery at the west texas pool from july to augustforbut increased volumes from mmbtu day to mmbtu day ena citizens utilitiesthe new citizens interconnect for the griffith power plant was scheduled to be purged and filled with gas this week as manager of citizen s transport agreement ena has notified us verbally they will request some or all of the mmbtu d of primary delivery capacity for that point as soon as we receive their request in writing we will discuss strategy with legal and regulatory to evaluate all tw s options duke atokacrawford proposalfor a construction contribution from tw duke is willing to build out part of their gathering system to unload mmbtu d off the atoka lateral and redeliver gas to tw s crawford lateral tw would receive ayear ft at a rate ofplus actual fuel oasis would be the primary delivery point this project has the added benefit of allowing tw to sell incremental space on the atoka lateral in addition duke is proposing to install additional compression to deliver up to mmbtu d of incremental volume to tw off the zia plant in exchange tw would provide a discountedit transport rate for a two year term the zia gas would flow through a new tap into tw s high pressureline this project has a fuel saving benefit to tw by eliminating one stage of compression from the low pressure system
