 notethis interview with jack crawford of alliance is probably the best information we have gained on the pipeline operational start up and background information vector may still be iffy for decfingers crossed alliance vector shoot for decalliance pipeline informed its shippers yesterday that all debris has been cleared from the pipe all connections are up and running and that commercial service will begin on deccommercial service originally was expected to begin on octbut was delayed several times because of commissioning problems we ve tested all of our connections and we ve been flowing volumes [to midwestern ldcs] up to about half [ mmcf d] of what the pipeline is capable of transporting said alliance spokesman jack crawford we are asking our shippers today to provide forecasts to us of what they expect to do in the first month the last time we did this the forecasts we got suggested that we d be running at about bcf on the first day one of the key questions remaining is whether alliance s main downstream supply outlet the mile vector pipeline project will be ready to go as well on decvector had construction problems because of wet weather and also was forced to delay its startup from novthe pipeline would transportmmcf d of gas initially from joliet il through indiana and michigan to dawn on but would be expanded tobcf d next november the last i heard they were expecting to make [the deadline] said crawford we actually tested our meter with them over the weekend and it s all up and running but that might be a subsequent event if they have a problem it s been a challenge for them to get going but it looks like they are all ready to go a vector spokesman confirmed that commissioning is going smoothly and operations appear to be on schedule for decstartup right now everybody still feels that decis doable he said you might want to touch base again next week and see how it looks but right now it looks like we re getting things pretty well wrapped up the last place where we ve been completing work has been up in the milford and highland townships in oakland county mi that s the area just before we go in the portion of the pipeline that we re leasing from michigan consolidated gas co as of last friday they still hadn t reached that area with linepack [gas] crawford said the aux sable liquids plant also is up and running and previous pipeline coordination difficulties have been ironed out they are still bringing it up to full scale they are short both volume and heat content at the moment and that s by design the pipeline is flowing at about half volume at the moment and in addition to that we ve been running lean test gas farther upstream alliance still has one lateral the peace river lateral that will be delayed because of the impact of wet summer weather on construction it will be up and running perhaps not by decbut in a week or two it s an eight and inch line it s relatively small he said once the massive new pipeline is running smoothly the next steps to be taken include potential connections with several proposed pipelines in and around chicago including potentially the guardian horizon and whitecap energy projects we also looked at a couple of other receipt connections on the upstream side said crawford we ve obviously talked about a potential expansion in the future but as we found out by talking to people it looks like the supply additions in the western canadian sedimentary basin have not been as brisk as we might have thought probably because of the downturn in the oil price a couple of years ago it s likely that an expansion would be delayed for a year or two or even three the best that i ve been able to ascertain from talking to people is that our supply deliverability really has not increased very much in the last two to three years and as a consequence at least in the short run the gas on our system will end up coming out of other systems he also mentioned that transcanada is planning to take some of its capacity out of service including retiring some older compressors and rewheeling others in order to reduce the amount of excess pipeline capacity in the canadian gas market
