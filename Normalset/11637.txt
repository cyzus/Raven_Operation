 this sheet is as complete as possible and i am worried about it due to the following circumstances;the dispatch sheet that comes to real time wasmw flat on sunday and llh on monday more than all the preschedules that were tagged todaythe four corners values on that dispatch sheet changed between and frommw long to flat i tried to resolve the four corners schedules with psco who told me they did not have a purchase from epe in july i tried calling numerous people at their office and cell phone numbers and got forwarded to enron each time lisa had a buy resale with pnm at four corners but that booked out and did not seem to match thelong that i saw in the dispatch sheet i spoke with pete who assured me that the sale to psco was good for the summeri still was unable to resolve themw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule no epe representative was available to tell me what they were expecting for the schedules and i was referred by a dispatch person to call on saturday and speak to carlos when he came in atpm i was very uncomfortable doing this and so in my desperation called roger at home who after some discussion with steve at his home confirmed that the extratflat sunday and llh monday was a deal that is supposed to begin on julyi trust his assesment and have removed the extra schedule from the sheet between all of the preschedulers today at enron we have spent overhours dealing with the epe schedules today the sheet is as complete as i possibly can find justification for cara semperger west power scheduling
