williams iii bill nonprivileged pst i have one more thing to add to the list of enpower requestsdeals done under the epmi short term west hourly desk do not need to be confirmed the real time traders know they need to check no in the confirmation box in deal entry; however it s one detail amidst many that sometimes gets overlooked it occurred to me that we could avoid the problem of real time deals getting unnecessarily confirmedand unnecessarily confusing counterpartiesif we could make no confirmation an automatic default for all deals entered under the short term west hourly book i can t think of any other groups which would be adversely impacted by this change but let s discuss that during the next enpower meeting please let me know what we can do to get this implemented thanks for your help kate
