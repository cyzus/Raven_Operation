 vince i agreei ll talk with sherriff when he gets back to london next weekdale vince j kaminskitodale surbey lon ect ect ccvince j kaminski hou ect ect subjectresteve leppard dale my recommendation is to make steve the head of the research unit in london we were talking originally about september but i think we should accelerate this process of course anjam will be very unhappy about it but we cannot manage around him any longer i think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase i would like to offer him a significant increase that goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility a salary increase will also bring him closer to the market we see the market for technical people going through the roof in practically every location where we operate a contract is not a good solution in my view it creates a sense of false security for both an employee and the company i shall send a message to john sherriff with my recommendation i shall cc you i would appreciate if you could bring it up with john as well vince dale surbeyam tovince j kaminski hou ect ect ccsubjectsteve leppard hi vince hr is working on a midyear salary review for london people that have a noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to pay in the market for a replacement they highlighted steve as someone with a potential gapparticularly in light of what we re seeing in our quant recruiting effort for credit trading and research i d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and keep him at enron there are several things i see we can do give him a midyear pay increase to move him closer to market i m not sure this is the best way to go especially if we only offer him a token salary increaseoffer him more responsibilitywhat are your thoughts on timing for making steve the official head of the london research teamwith my move to ebs should we accelerate thisi think this is good way to keep him happy and motivated and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at yearend as part of the regular process that takes into account his greater responsibilitywe have some people that we re trying to get under longterm yr contract with a month notice clause obviously anyone signing one of these will want significant upfront compensation for being handcuffed we ve not had a lot of success with these here in london and i would prefer to keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually binding him to the job i d value your thoughts on this thanks dale
