 Here s a summary of our conversation so you have points to follow up with General Status of the Database modelFIX not representedneed to incorporate into common design and standardizemight cause some FIX rework Referential Integrity not entirely enforcedpotential for bad data to develop Snapshots from Global databases are currently dailythis can be easily changed to be more frequent but need to consider implementation as decision on direction of Global as a part of Commodity Logic is made Rate information not developedneed integration with Rate Server or MKM preferably MKM Need to define how MKM will be usedwhether just for index names or to obtain actual settlement prices or curves as well Application development is not currently occurring on a single version of the database Therefore some issues could arise as each development team migrates to the standard This needs to happen relatively quickly Specific IssuesGFD PIPE METERS SNPProbably need to add FAC TYPE WH ITE etc for possible use as validation in KX functionality GAS DEAL LOCATION DTLThis table refers to facility number rather than pipe and meter Facility number is an Enronism that no other company will recognize Pipe and Meter GeneralShould try to avoid using Pipe Cd as key This value needs to be updateable as pipelines are bought and soldData for Facilities is heavily dependent upon Enron Global Facilities Database in current design and functionalitythis needs revisiting as the decision surrounding Global is made CP ADDR VWThis table references only internal cp id and contact type cd in conjunction with address id Addresses are specific to internal cp id product cd deal nature cd contact type cd and region cd Need to add deal nature product and region to ensure correct address usage since many companies align their business along these determinants and addresses may vary COUNTERPARTYThere is a mixture of the usage of Global Counterparty Some areas indicate a certain amount of independence from Enron s Global Counterparty system by having a table to capture Commodity Logic information on a counterparty such as phone numbers credit ratings etc This would position CL to become independent at a later date Yet Commodity Logic functions as a subset of Enron Networks and GCP must make entries to indicate the usage of a customer by Enron Networks to obtain an SAP id and support payment processing through to SAP So CL could not become independent without further functionality or process changes So why not put the added data requirements within GCP to start withIf Global moves to Commodity Logic then this design needs to be revisited for sure There should probably be some standardization between dependence independence whether or not CL separates from Enron Common DataStatus is not included in the views being utilized by the applications I hope the views have been filtered for active status only Show was going to check on thisConcept of mapping others codes to ours for processing is not supported anywhere in these tables Perhaps that has been handled in an isolated manner in the FIX designThis will have to be there for internal release as well as external release This is critical to the hub concept I look forward to sitting in on your meetings surrounding these issues Let me know if you have further questions
