 as we discussed this is the proposed solution i may need you to speak tosomeone at umbrella call lance if you have a question original message from schuler lance legal sent wednesday december pm to muller mark s ; detmering tim cc golden jeff; daniels eddy; koehler anne c ; cook mary subject reps warranties as we have discussed we are not in a position to commit to convey all properties assets rights etc that are used in enron s current business of trading physical and financial natural gas and electricity and associated risk management products as the document is currently drafted all items gounless specifically excluded the danger to the estate is that because the catchall phrase is so broad we know now that many items will not be identified and then cannot be recovered the sellers will continue their business subject to the negotiated noncompete; however most everything could be deemed to be used in the business the requested reps warranties apply not just to the assets they are to receive but to the business statedabove so they are for example demanding that we identify and list every employment and consulting agreement pursuant to which someone is performing services in the operation of the business and each contract with a termof one year or more that has been made in connection with the business unless relating solely to identified excluded assets these constructs wouldpick up literally thousands of other contractseven confidentiality agreements for example we propose the following solution we have prepared a schedule of specific assets that should be transferred to netcowe would give a sufficiency rep to assure the buyer that the listed assets are all the material assets necessary for netco to operate a business similar to the business referenced above we have communicated to the potential buyer that netco would need to attain certain assets and these would be identified in writing in the rep for example certain thirdparty licenses and some hardware itemsthe rep would have to be tailored to exclude certain items such as office spacewe would give negotiated reps on the specified assets and in limited appropriate circumstances on the business other than the asset list we would not list all of any specified requirement but only necessary exceptions to the reps as negotiatedwe would give a broad further assurance covenant to provide without further cost to netco but subject to any required consents anything that is later identified as being appropriate for their conducting the businesswe view this as an mbo type transaction involving the sale of assets whereby the people going to netco know the underlying business best and canidentify specifically the assets that should go both for the contract to begin with but also in a very short period of time postclosing by using the further assurance clause w lance schuler enron north america corpsmith street houston texasphonefaxemaillance schulerlegal enron com
