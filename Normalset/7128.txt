nysenewscommentary appears to be relying on asset sales to offset weakness in its highprofile energy trading operation a billiondollar sale of power plants likely made a hefty contribution to the energy giant s secondquarter profits which are supposed to owe their rapid growth to the company s wellpublicized trading acumen a smaller sale of impaired assets to an affiliate company also may have helped nudge secondquarter numbers past wall street earnings estimates one energy market source alleges the price tag on this deal was inflated complicating matters enron s financials make it difficult to determine exactly how much these deals may have contributed to earnings for its part enron flatly denies that it used onetime gains to meet estimates or that the price of the impairedassets sale was inflated but dependence on asset sales would mark a big step backwards for houstonbased enron which has long told investors that trading is its future by shrewdly capturing a dominant position in the nation s fastgrowing energy market enron has expanded trading profits exponentially over the last couple of years operating earnings from trading surgedinto billion causing the stock to double now there s chatter that enron s swashbuckling traders were caught out by the second quarter s unexpected drop in the prices of power and other energy commodities in addition the company booked a large loss in its broadband unit if asset sales can t be repeated and trading income weakens earnings could crater observers say which could pull enron s already battered stock down even lower in fact fear that enron s prodigious profits growth won t be sustained is the chief reason its stock price has dropped by half this year other factors have contributed as wellinvestor dissatisfaction over enron s opaque and confusing financial statements have risen throughout the year and earlier this month ceo jeff skilling quit after only six months on the job skilling s departure sparked all sorts of dark theories about the real reason for his sudden move enron chairman ken lay who has now reassumed the ceo post said this week that he aims to improve enron s disclosure he has moved to allay concerns over toplevel instability by promoting two experienced enron executives to the positions of president also vacated by skilling and vice chairman but skeptics remain unconvinced i think the secondquarter performance was bad in the trading operations and was covered up by asset sales says mark roberts director of research at off wall street a cambridge mass based stock analysis firm that doesn t do underwriting off wall street issued a critical report on enron in may for the quarter enron madecents a sharecents more than analysts had expected details details one transaction investors want details on is the sale by enron north america of three gasfired power plants to allegheny energy supply a unit of allegheny energy aye nysenewscommentary hagerstown md the deal took place in may for a price of billion according to allegheny s recent securities and exchange commission disclosures allegheny declined to comment on the deal enron s secondquarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three socalled peaker plants says roberts he believes the gain on the sale may have been as high asmillion an energy company analyst at a wall street brokerage thinks it may have been closer tomillion his firm hasn t done recent underwriting for enron enron s financial statements don t specify the size of the gain from the peakers so called because they supply power when demand is strong the company declines to offer a number saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold however enron s public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity salesandservices line which is by far the biggest contributor to enron s earnings producingmillion in operating profits in the second quarter the problem is that the firm s trading profits also are booked in this segment as a result investors can t know how much of the quarter s blowout commodity salesandservices earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading if robertsmillion estimate is correct trading may have accounted for onlymillion in secondquarter operating profit partners indeed the other deal that s raising eyebrows is the sale in june by enron of texasbased assets that are used to produce mtbe methyl tertiarybutyl ether the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently the assets were sold formillion by one subsidiary of enron to another subsidiary called eott energy partners eot nysenewscommentary chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil any gain on the sale would have been booked in enron s wholesale line the issues with the deal are plenty it took place on juneright at the end of the second quarter this could be construed as a sign that enron pressed eott to do the deal then so it could include any gain in secondquarter results then there s the question of price enron took amillion impairment charge against these mtbe assets at the end ofresponding to what it described at the time as significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of mtbe some environmental authorities believe mtbe to be a dangerous substance and claim the mtbe content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels skeptics askhow can enron turn aroundmonths after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets formillionin addition an executive at another energy company that talked to enron about buying the mtbe assets claims they re worthmillion at most; he claims enron has long been trying to sell them for aroundmillion put bluntly did enron stuff eott with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectationsan enron spokeswoman respondseott views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business it makes good business sense and a recent eott sec disclosure states that eott s audit committee made up of three directors who aren t employees or officers of any enron affiliate as well as an investment bank judged the sale price to be fair however the chairman of the audit committee daniel whitty is a director for two other enron subsidiaries he declined to comment on the deal a person familiar with enron s business adds that it was eott that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in thirdquarter numbers this person also says the gain was immaterial to enron s secondquarter numbers since there wasn t a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold most important this person insists themillion price isn t based only on the assets sold eott is also paying for a contract with enron that gives eottyears worth of mtberelated business what s more enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in mtbe production this person states whatever the case with the mtbe assets enron would go a long way toward fulfilling lay s promises of glasnost by breaking out assetsale gains they need to put their disclosure where their mouth is concludes off wall street s roberts know any
