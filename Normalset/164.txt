 Just thought I would give you all an update on the pilot We sent out an annoucement last night water dropping the classes and inviting others to participate As of this morning most classes were filled and a waiting list was developing Several observationsmost people were signing up forclasses so the decision to run these in halfday increments was a good choice on your part the fact that there is already a waiting list after two hours shows the pentup demand for this type of skill building program the skills you have targeted were right on That is not to say there are not other ones that are needed but clearly these first ones are needed If you have a couple of folks you want to fit in and did not get time to get those to us please give me a call or send me an email and I will get them in Gracie and Janice are overwhelmed by Ernie calls that have been extremely heavy these past two days I think I can pull some strings for you all Again just thought I would keep you posted and thought you might want to pat yourself on the back for some great work and great choicesFromSusan RunkelPM ToSheila Glover HOU ECT ECT Brent A Price HOU ECT ECT Leslie Reeves HOU ECT ECT Stephen P Schwarz HOU ECT ECT ccGary Buck HOU ECT ECT Norma Villarreal HOU ECT ECT Sally Beck HOU ECT ECT Gracie S Presas HOU ECT ECT Janice Riedel HOU ECT ECT SubjectLeadership Development Progress Thank you again for participating in the Leadership Development vendor selection process in December Based on the decisions we made at the meeting we are ready to conduct a pilot Februaryof six modules from Wilson Learning Corporation The purpose of the pilot is to evaluate Wilson Learning materials and facilitators and present a portion of the Leadership curriculum We will also pilot the communications module for nonsupervisory employees We ask that you invitemanagers from your group to participate and evaluate the modules Participants should plan to complete a minimum of two modules In addition you are invited to participate in as many as you would like We are also opening this pilot to managers throughout ENA to ensure that the material adapts well We are currently completing the curriculum design and plan to have information available in February As you may remember these are the decisions we reached at the meeting in DecemberUse Southwest Performance Group SWP and Wilson Learning products as our primary vendor and Achieve Global as a secondary Create an Enron faculty of outside facilitators that meet our specified requirements Ensure that the skills in our curriculum are matched to different levels of manager Ensure that we incorporate data available from consultants currently working with Energy Operations Incorporate current Enron course offerings into ENA curriculum Attached for your review areFacilitator Profile Curriculum Tablemapping skills to courses Descriptions of each module are also attached for your review The following are halfday sessions Supervisors may sign up for any or all depending on their need It would be helpful if supervisors attend a minimum of two modules We need to have a minimum ofparticipants for the course to be effective As an added bonus I will cover the cost of attending the pilot As you may remember cost for attending programs inwill be charged back to the business unit Date Module Time Target Audience FebMeeting Leadership Challengesam Supervisors with less thanmonths experience Working Stylespm Any supervisor FebCoaching To Performanceam Any supervisor Motivating For Resultspm Any supervisor FebCommunicating Effectivelyam Any employee Delegating and Directingpm Any supervisor Other detailsSessions will be held in RoomParticipants should plan to attend a minimum of two sessions Please call Gracie Presas to register by FebruaryDescriptions of each module are provided in the attachment If you have further questions concerning this pilot please contact me atAgain thank you for all your work in this importanct effort
