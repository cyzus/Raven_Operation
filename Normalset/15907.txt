 george here is one statistical method linear regression applied to hosanna s fund giving the method is deterministic where contributions each sunday are attempted to be explained by significant events on the church s and members calendars and the method shoudl be considered in contrast to an anecdotal one where each sunday s giving might be estimated to be the average giving of the same sunday e g each nd sunday in january in the past the following effects are estimated independently by the computer they add and subtract with each other accordingly; some sundays can have more than one effect in playmost positive for givingan additional for special pastoral appealsof them in the pastyearspositive for givingan additional easter and nearest christmas sunday an additionalthanksgiving sunday and a tiny additionaleach week pure time trendnegative for givingfor sundays of monday federal holiday weekends and during the summer june aug wave there is anper week wavegivinghigher one weeklower the next etc the computer can explain roughlyof the absolute variation in giving the pastyears using this approach keep in mind much of the information statistically is captured in the pastoral appeals easter and christmas sundays and holiday weekends the rest of the variation cannot be explained by this simple model i e it looks like noise here are the predictions for fund giving for the upcoming year you can cutandpaste these numbers to any file or spreadsheet you like they may seem boring to you; please remember they are the deterministic components of a process that involves a lot of volatility and your church s actual experience will predictably be volatile these numbers are asif the means of experiences dependent on the standard deviations best wishes clayton vernon manager research
