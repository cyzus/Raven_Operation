 i spoke with berney this am as you mentioned i believe he needs some more a risk premium in his words i told him that the intent is not to simply be a blocktrading spec shop but we do have a genuine interest in structured customer deals also the size of his group is irrelevant because the marketers will be asked to structure on their own and i will want berney to have some oversight to ensure quality and consistency as well as helping out on all of the big deals chris calger
