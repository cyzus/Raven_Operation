michelle in speaking with laura kunkle yesterday i learned that the land owner notification was sent onand should be back by aboutalso the environmental matrix is in the hands of butch russell in albuquerque so should be ready this week the electrical drawings are being done by frances balderas in omaha and be ready by this weeks end my understanding is that pogo will build the facility per our spec s and we will operate it they won t purchase materials until their well comes in pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half just to recap we will need a chromatograph sulphur monitor water monitor flow control positive shutin and a means of overpressure protection the chromatograph will require commercial electricity operation of the facility without the above will have to be approved by rich jolly george kneisley do you have any input not mentioned abovein speaking with you yesterday i think all of these are covered but just want to make sure

enron team carlsbad et s enron enron mike mccracken et s enron enron darrell schoolcraft et s enron enron subjectpogo interconnect michelle i was wondering where we stand now on the pogo interconnect south of wt on the west texas lateral per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded like theday landowner notification would be the biggest hold up what will be the design capacity for the interconnecti think you told me but i can t find it in my notes my understanding is that there will be a chromatograph sulfur monitor water monitor flow control and a way to shut in if pressure reaches our maop also who will own and operate the stationlet me know if i m off base on any of this or what i ve missed and also don t hesitate to call if you need anything please let us know as things progress thanks arnie work home cell page
