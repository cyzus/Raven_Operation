 the question came up yesterday whether a shipper who contracts for firm capacity for a year or more at a negotiated rate is entitled to a rofr i ve done some checking and the answer is no a negotiated rate shipper that entered into a contract after march does not automatically get rofr rights this was clearly stated by ferc in order no a it does not matter whether the negotiated rate is above the maximum tariff rate; the contract is still not considered to be at maximum rates for rofr purposes as you know our tariff does allow us to mutually agree to include rofr rights in a contract with a shipper who does not automatically get rofr rights any questionslet me know
