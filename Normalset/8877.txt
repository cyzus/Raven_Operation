 original message frombelden tim sentthursday december pm tolavorato john; whalley greg subjectgetting a deal done i recognize that we are in a very fluid process right now however i feel that i currently don t possess the information that i would need to make a decision about what structure and compensation would work for me and people on my team in newco i will attemp to lay out the issues that concern me and provide thoughts on what i have heard about structures so far excuse me if i am off on any or all of my facts i am currently receiving mostly secondhand information from gas and power traders in houston here is the citibank deal as i understand itrequirement to retain betweenandemployees to do the deal fund at some unknown level a retention pool to be distributed in some unknown manner to an unknown subset of thenewco peopleemployeesmillion of dayvar totalcosts of approximatelymillion bonus pool equalsof ebit bonus paid outin cash andin restricted stock with a year cliff vest here are my concerns the cost structure appears to be well above what amillion var trading operation can support my recollection from west power rovar is roughlyin inand close toinandi m not sure how to handicap expected future rovar but without additional information from the two of you i have a hard time expecting more thanin a lowerpriced commodity market given that assumption themillion oneday var becomesmillion annualized var gives you gross margin ofmillion i don t know what the capital and credit charges will be for arguments sake let s call itmillion bonus pool equalsmillion of which is cash and equity i can t sign up for that math please help me understand how why my math is wrong i need to understand our cost structure in great detail we need to figure out a way to allocate costs to the desk level if i look at west power everyone in portland assume that we havepeople with an average of for base salary and benefits giving us total personnel costs ofmillion add on anothermillion for rent parking travel and entertainment and call itmillion of direct expenses here i figure that we can makemillion inwith lower var and starting up later in the year how much of themillion remaining costs should i expect to be allocated to the west power desk with an ebit ofmillion timesi can sell if we have anothermillion of allocated costs then i can sell this i recognize that the potential buyer is unlikely to fund a desk by desk ebit however i think that our goal should be to split the pie based on a desk by desk ebit and would like to see a proforma that accomplishes that proposed retention structure for three people in portland a dollar amount paid in cash over one year and equity over two years price tag tbd create certainty around the bonus retention payments indemnify against payback of deferred comp clarify total retention dollars for the rest of the deskof gross margin for of ebit going forward other gripes labor has not been invited to the negotiating table labor doesn t get to see the pro forma we are supposed to get paid based on ebit yet i have no control over the expense side or the allocation side labor is getting accused of holding up a deal that labor had no part in negotiating labor is the most important driver of the value of this deal and doesn t appear to have any rights other than to accept or reject a poorly defined structure i want to make this thing work i am not trying to be greedy i am finding it very difficult to navigate through this process given the very limited information that i have been given tim
