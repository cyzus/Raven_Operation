withdrawal rates decline with inventory as field pressure is reduced pressure in the market will be reinforced and extended throughand probably intoduring the past two summers high prices have been required to discourage demand and allow overall us storage injections to reach barely trillion cubic feet tcf if normal weather holds for the remainder of this winter tcf of injectionswhich would be nearly impossible to achievewould be required duringif inventories are to recover to tcf at peak if weather this winter is merely normal from middecember through march going into winter next year the united states will have considerably less gas in storage reaching even the bcf level according to cera estimates see tablewould require an additionalbcf of injections next year and that alone would prove challenging pricethe cold weather path the weakness of storage inventories and the demand pressure in both core and power generation markets created by the cold weather have caused prices to move onto and even above cera s cold weather path for this winter see tablestorage inventories would become perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather through middecember proves accurate and the injections required next summer would keep pressure in the market intense for these reasons cera s outlook for prices for january and throughoutnow reflects the cold weather path prices could take an even higher path particularly if colderthannormal weather endures beyond middecember or returns on a sustained basis in january or february several forces that could weaken prices duringwill begin to enter the market during the winter but these are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the winter is over such factors include a building us supply capability growing imports softening oil prices allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter ends and potentially weakening economic growth although the influence of these factors will increase it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement that appears more and more certain next summer demandthe difficult next round of switching with gas prices hitting new record highs cera expects some additional demand to be priced out of the market because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most weeks since may however the easiest fuel switching in the power generation and industrial sectors has already occurred even though gas prices are currently above the level of distillate approximately per mmbtu in new york switching from gas to distillate requires changes in longstanding consumer habit will occur only over time and is likely limited in volume significant switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of distillate itself there are four major sources of additional demand response in industrial marketsadditional switching to resid in industrial boilers the next increment of demand to come out of the market is likely to be in the industrial sector through additional fuel switching to resid and to some extent to distillate these markets will continue to show some flexibility but will not represent a large volume cera estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably already begun to lose small amounts less than bcf per day in switching to resid given the consistency of gas price premiums greater than per mmbtu investment in restoring switching capability as premiums move far beyond this level industrial end users can be expected to take a closer look at reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their initial shortterm levels however such a change would require investment by industrial end users and the availability of resid in oil markets cera estimates that with focused investment over the course of a number of months to perhaps a year switching to resid could eventually reach as high as bcf per day there is already some movement here; given the impact of high gas prices on earnings energy prices have already begun to receive management attention switching to distillate us department of energy data suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical capability of switching nearly bcf per day to distillate in the short term this switch would represent additional distillate demand of over barrels per day bd in a us market of million barrels this marginal demand would move the distillate price in tandem with gas price and any additional switching among power generators to distillate would reinforce this price correlation in addition the availability of distillate inventories on site should restrict the quick switching to short periods of time and will not offer a longterm solution to tight markets shutting down industrial plants also offering some flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that use gas as a feedstock the major feedstock consumers are the ammonia and methanol industries and not surprisingly given the tight margins available manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to show suppressed gas demand however in the short term only a portion of ammonia production is at risk whereas the production needs of merchant facilities along the gulf coast is relatively readily replaced by imports substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast because of transportation logistics and for facilities whose production is linked to valueadded fertilizer products hence cera still estimates that even with nonexistent margins substantial ammonia production would continue with additional losses of perhapsmillion cubic feet mmcf per day of potential demand in addition to the facilities that have already closed extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the shuttering of north american methanol capacity putting at risk anothertommcf per day of gas demand for that sector switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated in the chemicals paper and refining sectors in the south and the food products sector in the midwest continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the south central region for process users even extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have little impact on the use of gas in the short term energy costs are not the dominant component of production costs for these users and a physical changeover would be timeintensive and elemental in its impact on enduse product quality the northeastcold weather operations begin all of the northeast pipelines have issued notices to customers that they either have imposed or are highly likely to need to impose transportation restrictions of various types the most common restriction is to nonprimary firm services secondary and interruptible type services which will be scheduled for the next several days on many pipelines other pipelines have issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and deliveries must match even hourly flow orders have also been implemented these actions are normal for winter operations when a cold period is expected whereas the firm market for natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions the spot market becomes much more volatile as interruptible supplies dry up the spot market primarily made up of nonfirm customers has had a dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of delivered spot gas into the market area as has been reflected by the volatility of the cash market this week the result of these restrictions of nonprimary firm services has been an expansion of basis to henry hub at one point gas for nextday delivery to new york traded near per mmbtu delivered although the average price was closer to these high spikes are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas although these restrictions will likely ease as temperatures return closer to normal cera now expects basis into the new york citygate to average per mmbtu for december and per mmbtu for january end follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated tables come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek shooting the rapidsstrategies and risks for the energy future in houston february for more information and to register please visit httpwww cera com ceraweek this electronic message and attachments if any contain information from cambridge energy research associates inc cera which is confidential and may be privileged unauthorized disclosure copying distribution or use of the contents of this message or any attachments in whole or in part is strictly prohibited terms of usehttpwww cera com tos html questions commentswebmaster cera com copyrightcambridge energy research associates
