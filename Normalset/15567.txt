 ben thanks for attending i was on vacation last week driving from ca to houston and could not answer your first message regardoing insead conference in time the objective was to find out more about the he workshop on hightech acquisitions and evaluate the usefulness of the program for enron i shall be making a recommendation to jeff skilling that we should work with wharton as a partner in a number of different research projects i shall try to catch you next week to find out what was said about valuation of small hightech firms vince benjamin parsonsam tovince j kaminski hou ect ect ccbryan seyfried lon ect ect subjectinsead hightech acquisitions workshop vince i attended the workshop on hightech acquisitions at insead on saturday alongside participants from cisco eads razorfish and cable wireless and academics from insead and wharton the basic premise was to discuss and get feedback from practitioners about the research project and a phd study which is currently underway at wharton the discussions were very interestingespecially as this was my first exposure to this area examples of the discussions raised include why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them inhouse what degree of postacquisition integration was optimal difficulties of us firms acquiring euro asian hightech companies how to value small hightech firms how to quantify the success failure of an acquisition my feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give us firsthand access to the results plus it would enable us to learn from the mistakes of others through meeting practitioners at such workshops and having greater access to the case studies i guess it could also aid our realignment within the hightech communication industry to be seen in such studies regards ben
