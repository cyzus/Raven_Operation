 dear vince grant thanks very much for the offer to go to houston as a manager to work with tanya tamarchenko on var and credit risk within the houston research group as we discussed on the phone yesterday i felt that it would be useful to bring melanie doyle my hr rep into the equation i met melanie this morning to discuss the issues with respect to taking up the offer in houston i explained that the interest for this opportunity is mutual mine from a career progression perspective and houston research s to fill an urgent need melanie having had experience with these transfers before has kindly agreed to help out from an hr perspective probably involving some of the london houston team that are usually responsible for these situations i expect that you may receive a call from either melanie or a foreign assignment representative in the near future i would like to reiterate my interest in the opportunity but would like to make a counterproposal for the form of the contract; i would like to make the suggestion that we make this opportunity a oneyear assignment working with tanya and then reevaluate the situation at the end of the year in terms a new role for me in houston thereafter subject to mutual agreement the alternative situation of resigning from enron europe and rejoining enron corp is too dramatic and requires me to burn bridges and my return to enron europe would be difficult also i would lose the valuable support structures available to me in london the amount of any fixed costs flights modest cargo a few months of mortgage carrying cost are entirely reasonable not excessive given my single status and not so great that they justify making the contract a three year local one i would expect that on the basis of almostyears solid experience valueadded at enron europe the value of several million pounds i have identified justified to external auditors for enron europe this year and an excellent rating my fourth making myyr average rating also excellent i could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal i e my existing enron europe salary benefits package plus a reasonable oneoff allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses regards thanks again for the opportunity anjam x
