 i have written a c code to do the followingfor a given curve the code will filter out the seasonal factor it then fits the deseasoned curve to a smooth function of the form f ta a t b c withcthe curve fitting is achieved by using conjugate gradient methodas tanya pointed out this form of function ensures thatf ttf tt which is useful in calculating forwardforwardvolthe outputs are season patternsdifferent patterns are allowedand the smoothed curve one can then calculate forwardforward vol from the smoothed curve and superimpose the seasonal factors back onto the curvethis procedure is not useful for var calcuation however i believe itis useful for other situations which require the knowledge of seasonalforwardforward vols for example in power plant valuation and credit exposure simulations it would reflect the reality more closely if we add seasonality to our forwardforward vol in simulating the forward pricesattached are the spreadsheet and xll file i will forward the c code if any of you is interestedalex
