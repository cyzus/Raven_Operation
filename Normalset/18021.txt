implemented was pay at end of all periods now implemented is pay at end of each subperiod module still in beta release bug fixes if max const min const and max const in not a multiple of the maximum daily amount in previous version min const was disregarded in this casein strip with global constraintsif allowed number of swings per period changes currently this can only be due to calendar effectsstrip at indexindex was incorrectly evaluated after first sub period new excel templates the following excel workbooks and worksheets have been addedpowercalib xls examples of generatingenergy
