 olympian status for u s gas market just so you ll knowthe natural gas market is a real success story ferc has gotten an enormous amount of things right the market may not be unblemished but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across dozens of products it s something everyone should be proud of robert levin of the new york mercantile exchange told a ferc conference yesterday the natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of market conditions with hundreds if not thousands of market participants using an extraordinary selection of market instruments levin continued adding that the commission should be supporting the growth and increased sophistication of commerce you re at that point now warning against socalled solutions offered by some at the daylong conference to increase liquidity or tie the natural gas market to the electric market levin cautioned liquidity cannot be legislated don t overreact the electric market is poorly regulated remedies from the natural gas market should be transferred to the electric market rather than allow the gas market to be corrupted by the regulatory mistakes of the electric market rather than worry over regulating an hourly market for natural gas change the electric market which levin believes has developed its overemphasis on the hourly market because of the artificial tilt toward the spot market but while levin warned against too much market meddling others among the more thanrepresentatives of the industry and its customers testifying at ferc s conference on competitive natural gas markets argued for a variety of initiatives to increase market liquidity by changing the rules for pipeline transportation eliminating the shippermusthavetitle rule promoting expansion of the existing pipeline infrastructure especially in the northeast doing away with straightfixvariable sfv rate design review of firmtowellhead rates in the production region and the allocation of transportation costs between the upstream and downstream were among the chief proposals proffered by mostly pipeline customers however greater gas market liquidity shouldn t be confused with increased competition in pipeline transportation municipals and producers told ferc staff during a postordertechnical conference wednesday [w]e re concerned the commission may be equating market liquidity with competition in pipeline transportation the two are not the same said arthur corbin on behalf of the american public gas association apga which represents municipal gas distributors even with greater and greater market liquidity monopoly power exists in [the] pipeline transportation segment captive shippers will always require a regulated transportation service from any hub to their citygate he said much the same holds true for ldcs noted bruce henning director of energy practices for energy and environmental analysis inc eea who represented the american gas association aga at the commission staff conference he agreed market liquidity has improved immeasurably but he added there s not a liquid market center at every pipeline receipt or delivery point location nor is there likely to be market centers in all of these locations in the near future consequently henning said ferc will need to continue to protect producers from market power that accompanies limited access to pipelines the daylong conference held yesterday in washington d c was the first of several that ferc staff plans to hold to explore the impact of the commission s transportation policies on the development of gas markets christopher a helms president and coo of panhandle pipeline companies urged ferc not to enact policy changes that would place commodity market liquidity as the ultimate goal at the expense of the transportation market helms said he advocated policies encouraging pipeline expansions and construction of optimal amounts of additional capacity to meet the needs of the market the single most important characteristic for liquidity in the natural gas commodity markets is the availability of adequate transportation capacity charles daverio vice president of keyspan corp echoed that sentiment saying ferc could increase liquidity in the new york city market and elsewhere in the northeast by promoting construction of new pipeline capacity to ensure adequate supplies for the region yearround this would reduce energy costs and enhance reliability he noted panhandle s helms also cautioned against policy changes that would force the development of new market centers and hubs market centers should be allowed to develop at their own pace and at locations where the market sees fit he said eea s henning estimated more thanliquid and transparent market centers exist today which permit industry participants to buy and sell gas daily under extremely competitive conditions he said he s confident more will be added because of the options that they provide to gas customers as another way to enhance liquidity keyspan s daverioas well as otherssupported eliminating the shippermusthavetitle rule which requires the customer to retain title to the gas while it s being shipped doing away with the rule would pave the way for the development of new pipeline products and services such as operational balancing and virtual storage he told the ferc staff but dena wiggins an attorney with the d c law firm of sutherland asbill brennan llp which represents the process gas consumers group industrial gas customers said her group was very concerned about efforts to repeal the rule i haven t heard anything yet [today] that satisfies the concerns that we might have she noted the commission already has granted exceptions to the shippermusthavetitle rule in certain cases and should continue with this policy where necessary moreover wiggins said industrial customers were increasingly worried about the mounting market power of unregulated companies especially gas marketers at the conference she also expressed her group s dismay with the pipeline compliance filings with orderparticularly on the penalty issue rather than an improved penalty structure pipelines are proposing higher penalties wiggins said [we] continue to be shocked at the absolute wholesale departures frombp s jeff holligan also waded into the fight against all the new services outlined by pipelines in their orderfilings which he said were nothing more than penalties disguised as balancing services that customers can t refuse he urged the commission to check with a pipeline s customers noting one proposed new service is opposed byof the pipeline s nonaffiliated customers some of the proposed services holligan said add up to nothing more than degradation of existing longterm firm service holligan representing the largest producer in the u s and canada joined other market participants in urging adoption of standardized allocation sales standardized penalty levels and the requirement that all pipelines implement a uniform title transfer tracking process in short standardizing pipeline services certainly on an individual pipeline and also to a large extent between and across pipelines is imperative if markets are to be highly liquid individually negotiated services where every service is a different service or the adoption of a socalled dual track market are the antithesis of a highly liquid efficient and competitive gas market standardization of operational terms of pipeline service is necessary to facilitate trading through ecommerce the commission should be striving to commoditize pipeline capacity so it can be traded along with gas electronically holligan said
