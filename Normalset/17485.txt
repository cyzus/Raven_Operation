 tanya we are very close to generating factors for all primary curves jin almost get it done but we are still waiting on the expiration dates for those london curves if anyone can help please help also we have some curves that don t have futures how to decide these curves s expiration datesmatthew adams helped us deciding many curves expiration rules but there are still many primary curves that don t have expiration dates if no expiration dates then there will be no factor loadings whoever wants to generate factor loadings then give us the expiration dates first winston tanya tamarchenkoam tobjorn hagelmann hou ect ect wenyao jia hou ect ect ccvince j kaminski hou ect ect kirstee hewitt lon ect ect rodrigo lamas lon ect ect xochitl figueroa na enron enron manfred roenz corp enron enron christian lebroc corp enron enron bjorn hagelmann hou ect ect homan amiry lon ect ect naveen andrews corp enron enron subjectreprimary curves missing from factor loading bjorn you are absolutely right that we should run the factors for every primary curve it has been working for a while on this the problem is data as always missing price curves zero prices not changing prices etc most of these problems come from london curves so winston and jin yu are debugging the code fixing the problems for every curve winston do you think we are ready to calculate factors for us curveswhile continue working on the rest tanya frombjorn hagelmannpm totanya tamarchenko hou ect ect naveen andrews corp enron enron ccvince j kaminski hou ect ect kirstee hewitt lon ect ect rodrigo lamas lon ect ect xochitl figueroa na enron manfred roenz corp enron christian lebroc corp enron bjorn hagelmann hou ect ect homan amiry lon ect ect subjectreprimary curves missing from factor loading tanya naveeni am confused i thought that when we identified primary curves they would then have factors run against them does this not distort what we are trying to do with the primary and varregards bjorn hforwarded by bjorn hagelmann hou ect on xochitl figueroa enrontomanfred roenz corp enron enron christian lebroc corp enron enron homan amiry lon ect ect ccbjorn hagelmann hou ect ect subjectreprimary curves missing from factor loading i am in the same situation as manfred i have one primary curve for southern cone gas and one for southern cone power and i am not getting factors for either for my power curves i am getting wti factors and for gas i am getting ng factors but i do agree with you manfred i think all the primary curves should have their own factor loadings xochitl manfred roenzpm tochristian lebroc corp enron enron xochitl figueroa na enron enron homan amiry lon ect ect ccbjorn hagelmann hou ect ect subjectreprimary curves missing from factor loading christian at least you havecurves that you get factors for i get none i have four primary curves for coal but factors from nbsk are used in emissions i have one primary curve but wti factors are used i think all the primary curves should have their own factor loadings xochitl what factors are used for your primary curvesmanfred fromchristian lebrocam tohoman amiry lon ect ect manfred roenz corp enron enron xochitl figueroa na enron enron ccbjorn hagelmann hou ect ect subjectprimary curves missing from factor loading i was in the process of setting up sunil s template for calculating covariance on all liquids primary curves using the factor loading data unfortunately i did not get very far because i noticed that the factor loading table contains onlywti hu out ofliquids primary curves i am concern that liquids var could conceivably be over or understated due to the absence ofother curves which are listed below please verify your perspective commodity desk on this issue ny brent cgc cgc cxt condensate dubaicrude ic mtbe nc nxho christian
