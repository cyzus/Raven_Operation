 louise attached is the worksheet for both second quarter and ytd gross margin numbers for upstream and bridgeline broken out by originator and project please read the following bullet points that explain the derivation of gross margin and primary contributors to eachj m huberwas a producer netback transaction which transported distressed rockies gas and transported it on medicine bow and trailblazer landing the gas at ngplok gage this gage gas was sold to the central desk and the west desk kept the segmentation optionality associated with the transport the transaction was booked in fourth quarterand was attributed to mark whitt he received credit for this transaction in eoy prc at the time of the transaction mark reported to me i have this transaction because ena acquired trailblazer transport on behalf of j m huber the ferc approval certificate for the trailblazer transaction was not approved until second quarterthe mm reflects the p l associated with just the assignment of the trailblazer transport the remaining p l associated with this producer netback deal was captured last year transmission congestion contract tcc is the right to collect or the obligation to pay the dayahead congestion rents associated with onemegawatt mw of transmission between a specified point of injection poi and specified point of withdrawal pow the dayahead congestion rents are determined by the difference in the congestion component of the dayahead prices at the pow of the tcc and the congestion component of the dayahead prices at the poi of the tcc for each hour of the effective period i have this transaction because the transmission origination group reported to me last year the group was ultimately disbanded and reallocated maria tefel and peter bennett both analysts calculate the associated p l from these congestion contracts these contracts end in novembernote all transactions in executive are p l generated last year but for various reasons could not be declared i handle all the administrative and tracking to make sure that the p l shows up for ena s behalf in addition the expected budget for upstream products ofmm does not include executive since that p l is almost guaranteed and their product success should be differentiated the upstream product budget goals are list belowstorage mm; ecs mm; wellhead desk mm; producer ecommerce mm formosa upstream products partnered with duke energy field services defs to close a year ngl exchange and transportation deal with formosa hydrocarbons and williams energy field services to handle raw make product from the williams markham plant formosa hydrocarbons is building a bpd fractionator to handle this and other gulf coast ngl production the accompanying pipeline will be known as the seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by defs texas brine llc will provide ngl storage services for formosa hydrocarbons on this system primary production for this system is coming from the boomvang nansen field in the deepwater gom and will be the first deepwater gom production to come onshore in texas upstream products has also worked to arrange a year transportation lease agreement on the dean pipeline owned by teppco for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by formosa plastics coupled with this transaction enron clean fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with formosa plastics to utilize ecf s mt belvieu storage facilities in addition enron global markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with teppco to prematurely terminate a takeorpay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim ngl production coming from the williams markham to be delivered to mt belvieu upon close upstream products was monetized out of its initial position by defs and retained a riskfree net profits position on the seabreeze pipeline going forward for an additionalbpd of excess capacity on the system bieniawski negotiated with hilgert forof the gross margin associated with formosa bieniawski negotiated with texas brine to provide the ngl storage services for formosa hydrocarbons this storage capacity was key to formosa hydrocarbons to handle the ngl production expected and anticipated from the gom since john goodpasture ecf refused to acknowledged any value associated with the propylene storage agreement they entered into with formosa plastics negotiated by hilgert bilberry i granted outk in origination from executive which was dispensedecs andstorage based on conservative assumptions i expect this transaction to generate a minimum of mm p v for ecf theoretically the mm next to chris hilgert s name should be shared with mike bilberry but since the enron value associated with formosa was much greater than the p l reflected in upstream products please keep this in mind hubbard was a compression transaction closed inthe mtm value recognized upfront for this transaction was based on minimum guaranteed load profiles for the electric horsepower with this compression transaction there is significant accrual earnings potential if the electric compressor is run at a higher load profile because the shippers pay in mmbtu to the compressor owner who then gives the natural gas to ecs llc where it is monetized mark knippa closed this transaction and is responsible for coordinating with carol carter the accrual opportunities for ena pluto megswhen i was examining my capital charges fori assigned lisa druzbik to analyze all accounting cashflows and capital charges associated with this project although the gross margin associated with this transaction is not originated she did a great job creating the project proforma and helping me reassign this deal to ecr mariner tennessee gas pipeline was the virtual compression deal closed at the end of second quarter by chris meyer a virtual compression deal maintains the contractual obligation to fulfill the physical delivery of molecules and circumvents the need for running compression the wellhead desk sold bcf to tennessee and will deliver it into a storage facility providing adequate pressure not to run their expensive electric compression during the summer for storage withdrawals ena captured value by selling gas above market and also received intramonth flexibility for the delivery of the gas into storage you have already received a memorandum from john grass to me discussing his accomplishments ytd for the wellhead desk and producer ecommerce if you need further clarification please let me know i know this email is long but the devil is in the details i will discuss themm in origination associated with bhlp as well as my accomplishments in a follow up email mrha i
