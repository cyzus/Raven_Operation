 steve signoff from the research group is something that requires defining formal rules going forward my concern over the last few years was that we were asked on many occasions to signoff on partial results of valuation without the benefits of a full picture sometimes we were asked to signoff on trade ideas over which we have no control longterm i shall talk to rick buy and david port about setting up more formal rules for the research signoff vince steven leppardam tosharad agnihotri lon ect ect cctani nath lon ect ect ted murphy lon ect ect james new lon ect ect vince j kaminski hou ect ect subjectresearch sign off hi sharad i note from our discussion earlier this morning that you ve been asked to sign off a calculation from another group which is something we re asked to do from time to time i take the view that we in research can assess a computation in terms of what it achieves with respect to its requirements what its shortfalls are and therefore what the risks associated with using this method are we cannot provide an opinion on whether these risks are acceptable to enron which i feel falls firmly within rac territory this then raises the question of can research sign off anything for other groups after allto sign off means to accept something which our opinion in itself cannot do it is most appropriate for us to provide a technical note outlining the methodology risks and shortcomings of a method leaving the formal sign off to those best placed to assess these risks for our company the alternative is for multiple groups each to have their own view on what is acceptable risk for the company steve
