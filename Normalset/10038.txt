 optimization facility planning team weekly report week of september et s outages outagesjerry graves system optimization team team leaderben asante tw fuel performance measurement model fpm working with the scada support group to identify the equivalent scada pointsto existing mips points for conversion of the model to a realtime basis aninitial query revealed that only of mips points have a scadaequivalent priority will be given to identification addition of points onthe san juan lateral and the thoreau junction to needles developing an estimate of the time required to complete the conversion of thefpm model to a realtime basis tw fuel performance measurement for fuel overage forecasting the revenue risk management group are analyzing the existing fpm modelgroupings to evaluate the use of our model in combination with their demandmodel the combined model would provide fuel burned on forecasted demand initial analysis looks promising and they hope to give us an answer by nextweek whether the fpm model can be used as is beaver to mullinville bc sweepingpipeline operating conditions have been analyzed since the sweep wascompleted onrecent sweeps had improved flow efficiency only about last week s sweep improved the efficiency byto aboutpressuredrops decreased frompsi down to aboutpsi mullinville has operatedwith one lesshp unit while beaver units are operating with less loadwhile producing lower suctions outage modeling ran hydraulic models for gas control to determine flows with bisti down andwith unitdown san juan efficiency study developed multiple scenarios for san juan flows and pressures if the line wasto be cleaned basic economic analysis was also performed hydraulic model for eott the current eott hydraulic model has been revised to include the dependenceof the fluid properties on temperature and pressure as well the appropriateheat transfer considerations houston facility planning team team leaderperry frazier tw expansion studieslooked at different combinations of pipe loop and compression trying toreduce overall costs no luck so far a brainstorming session is schedulednext week to see if there are any different approaches not considered to date el paso field services compiling information for inclusion into the interconnect and operatingagreement between epfs and enron mostly locations materials and poinumber expect to have all information gathered by the end of the week san juan lateral enron operations services has visitedlaboratories in the area and compiledinformation on their analysis procedures they want facility planning tohelp evaluate and choose one for the sample evaluation results will takeaboutweeks also received some expected flow pressure enhancements forthe lastmiles of the sj lateral using the expected efficienciescalculated for a pressure profile taken after thechemical cleaningrun results will be reported next week liberal operationspride meeting attended operations meeting in liberal that covered various areas ofoperations and ways to improve facility planning did a presentation on theproposed emergency response program and provided general information onfacility planning services that can assist operations prospective market zone wichita kansas commercial requested market study of competitor pipelines serving thewichita kansas area duke kpl williams research possible loadrequirements and facility requirements to connect the area to nng s pipelinesystem wichita is located aboutmiles from the macksville compressorstation as a crow flies outage coordinationprovided the study to determine flows on the san juan lateral and mainlinewhen bisti outage occurs in october both san juan and the mainline willhave reduced flows study results were given to market services alsoprovided support for system optimization to determine the flows west whenstation unitis out of service marketing strategy meetingattended and participated in the marketing strategy meeting main assignmentfor planning is to continue looking for revenue generating projects e c participated in a review of the responding candidates for the vacant projectengineering position omaha facility planning team team leadersteve thomasearlville outage on october th starting at am the earlville unit will be taken down forrelocation of the blow down silencer solar will also be on site to do somebleed air manifold baffle modifications after this work is completed thedistrict will perform a water wash in preparation for emissions testing onoctober th th the unit should be back online sometime near midnighton october th with earlville down for this time frame the flow on the east leg will belimited to themmcf d range we anticipate that normal nominationswill be below this threshold and that by packing the system the night beforewe will be able to make it through without any impact gas control isputting this outage on the ebb from a marketing perspective we should limitshort term sustainables but ops did not want to call an allocation day ifwe did the allocation would beof firm in zone d for all deliveries the emissions testing on october th th will have very little impact onsystem flows planning white paper planning met with various marketing representatives to try and attach a valueto the four ideas put forth in the white paper the ideas were thoroughlydiscussed and the input we received will be incorporated into the paper one suggestion was that we use the pricing desk to determine the value of theadditional capacity we will be meeting with them to do that meanwhileresearch continues on the various costs associated with the white paper specifically sites for proposed inlet pressure additions engineering records research eogtexas co c this is an interconnect where the texas colateral okg connected to theokm an incorrect line number on the projectauthorization located the project six miles upstream of the actual site engineering records did not have the one page amendment with the projectauthorization to explain who owns and operates the facilities texas co facilities had been removed the remaining pipe downstream of the compressorsite to okm approximately miles has been transferred to eogresources as of june project authorization c removal ogden hs monitor sn verification of materials used in the construction of the monitor wasneeded operations confirmed that a farm tap assembly was used to create themonitoring facilities not to install a farm tap within the ogden plant yard cedar falls marketing needed to know if there was any money left in the work order topurchase a new regulator since the interruptible peaking turbine load iscausing problems with the existing regulator property accounting reportedthe amount remaining but it will not be enough for a new regulator st croix valley provided options for the proposed ten year expansion for st croix valley examined cost versus incremental growth on the black river falls branchlineprovided an analysis for option of integrating the growth with the wisconsingas proposal following the latest strategic marketing meeting will examinecompression alternatives for st criox valley as a standalone project grimes tbspressure increase working with marketing and the field examined several options regarding thecustomers request for a pressure increase to a delivery ofpsig marketing will examine all the options in order to determine best strategicfit for the customer ogden building discharge pressure research has been completed in trying to locate documentation that supportsthepsig maop for the building discharge header the supportingdocumentation has been forwarded to lisa choquette in codes for approval ifdocumentation is approved as supporting evidence for thepsig maop thenonly minor controls work will be required in the field in order to increasethe discharge pressure of the building engines pengilly tbsmesabi system marketing was presented with two separate estimates for modification requiredto increase firm at pengilly frommcf day tomcf day the firstestimate for consisted mostly of contract labor with field personnelonly installing the efm the team responded with a proposal that they wouldbe willing to do all of the labor if it could be scheduled during janmarcha second estimate of was submitted to marketing which included alldistrict labor this estimate is contingent on completing the deal prior todec if a deal is made after dec then the higher costestimate applies monroe tbs mods pressure increase the monroe tbs mods project was released to engineering the project wasthe result of wigas raising the it load by approximatelymcf day theyalso requested a pressure increase at the station frompsig to psig a formpressure increase request form is being circulated forsignature the project has a targeted nov inservice date themodifications consist of replacing both meters with spool pieces andperforming a pressure test to upgrade the maop milbank project continued gathering data to model the milbank system as it is today melbourneproject release the melbourne tbs mods project was released to engineering the projectconsists of tbs mods to support the increase of firm frommcf day to mcf day at melbourne presently the marshalltown b l is constrained and couldnot support the incremental firm alliant will realign gas away from themarshalltown tbs which is at the end of this b l to the marshalltownatbs which is on a different b l this will open up capacity on the line forthis new load the project has a targeted nov inservice date modifications consist of replacing the first and second cut regulators andreplacing the meter adela tbs modsproject release the adela tbs mods project was released to engineering this project wasa result of the customer wanting to convert an existing it load at adelato a firm load the new firm load will bemcf day the project has atargeted nov inservice date the station will have a new meterinstalled along with piping size modifications ethanol injection reviewed and researched for marketing the possibility of injecting ethanolinto the pipeline for a possible green energy rating and as a means of btuenhancement since ethanol would remain a liquid at any normal pipelineconditions even atomizing the ethanol at the point of injection would notinsure the ethanol from liquefying dropping out and collecting into thepipeline low spots also there were many issues concerning possible liquidsentering the fuel systems of our equipment and other customersequipment planning recommended that this project not be pursued researched for marketing was the possibility of burning a methane ethanolmix in our equipment i e turbines in order to receive a green power rating solar was contacted concerning the possibility of coburning ethanol and methane as a manufacturer they said they would be willing towork with us however they only recommended it if it were to be a constantfuel source solar said there would be considerable fuel injection systemretrofits required also if this were not a constant fuel then there wouldhave to be two separate fuel systems coburn and methane only and acomplete fuel control system change with all that the project has beendeemed cost prohibitive vapor injection of propane vip service research was started for marketing into the possibility of injectingvaporized propane into the pipeline as a way of increasing capacity duringpeak days upon initial review many questions were generated by the planningteam concerning specific requirements of the new service i e of days yr firm daily firm etc planning awaits feedback from marketing before anymore action is taken electric generationproposal was reviewed for marketing from apa for an engineering study toreview the possibility of utilizing standby generators as electric producersfor the utilities during peak power times in the summer months a fewdiscrepancies were found and are being worked out before apa can be releasedto complete the engineering study beaver dehy a request was received from john sturn of the optimization team to review thecapacity of the mole sieve dehy system at beaver compressor station on the se line beaver is considering a capital project to reroute the dehysystem that is currently piped into the suction of the station to thedischarge thus increasing the capacity cogentrix power plant three detailed cost estimates for the cogentrix power plant proposals wereprepared and forwarded to marketing the details of the cost estimateincluded a breakdown of costs formaterial costs labor freight and taxes surveys permits construction support district labor engineering drafting asbuilts contingency overhead afudc the break down of costs was done for the sheldon lehigh and raun projectsin nebraska and iowa cherokee ethanol projects seven sites were examined for a proposed ethanol plant in cherokee county iowa the delivery volume was
