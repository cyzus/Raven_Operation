 network world fusion focusamy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today s focusthe storage revolution has begundear wincenty kaminski today s focusthe storage revolution hasbegunby amy larsen decarlo believe the hype we are in the middle of a storage revolution virtually overnight businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to terabytes of data and the number of users accessing that information is skyrocketing the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery it isnt just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that are changing how businesses handle storage the premium that companies place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound effect on their storage requirements businesses demand faulttolerant storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their employees suppliers and customers but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements on average double everymonths while processor speeds double everymonths companies are left with a quandaryhow can they manage the proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for the differential between capacity requirements and processor speedsthe simple answer to this question is to institute a wellexecuted storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support those needs bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those systems there are several ways to efficiently manage storage one of the best routes is consolidation that is pooling resources and managing storage as a system as opposed to a decentralized collection of file servers this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era when enterprise storage resided on mainframes but its actually a progressive step as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing the planning management and ongoing support of storage systems than it does with the physical location of the files next it is important to recognize that not all information is equally important to the organization consequently storage requirements vary by business application as in all areas of it it is important to make storage implementation decisions based on business needs businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for alternatives to the distributed file server storage model they want to speed access to stored files and remove bandwidthintensive backup and recovery operations from the lan networkattached storage nas supplies it professionals with one answer giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to stored data nas devices which have been widely available for years are optimized to process i o transactions though they promise better performance they dont remove backups from the transport network instead they supply a relatively easytodeploy solution to cross platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments many consider storagearea networks san to be the best longterm answer to current and future storage challenges because sans are designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network they alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated with more traditional storage models yet given the early deployment stage most companies are still in many of those capabilities are still largely untested in a production environment this newsletter will examine how through effective storage management it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery to their customers this newsletter will not focus on items like the least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library instead it will look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues ultimately the goal is to identify storage technology options and practices that work in realworld environments to contact
