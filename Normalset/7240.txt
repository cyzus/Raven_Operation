 featuresinformation servicesphysical benchmarksin an online world startup online commodity exchanges seem not to realize that there are several good reasons why benchmarks derived from volumetric indices may not workand may not be usefulfor physical products such as oil and petrochemicals but there are other routes to price discoveryby neil flemingaprglobal energy businesspage copyrightmcgrawhill inc somewhere nearinternetbased exchanges for energy oil petrochemicalsand hydrocarbon shipping have been launched worldwide over the past two years but most have since folded or been acquired it s interesting to notethat virtually all of those exchangesboth the survivors and the deceasedhave two things in commonthey were created from scratch by entrepreneurs from the technology world or from the industries their exchanges are or were intended to servethe businessmen and women behind them have followed the same train of thought in concluding that online trading was abusiness they could succeed at this train of thought can be broken down into four parts premise online trading is ``more efficient and will save its participants money premise i can capture some of those savings as site revenue premise my site will be the best site out there so everyone will use itpremise with all this liquidity i can construct benchmarks my benchmarks will be unimpeachably scientific and replace the existing unscientific benchmarks currently used by the industry as a result i will make even more money because i will become an information provider this article will examine those premises and the limits of their inherent logic with a view to showing why very fewif anyof thelaunched exchanges will survive in particular it will show why the logic of premiseis not valid for markets in physical commodities such as oil and petrochemicals premise online trading is more efficient few would question that in theory electronic trading has the potential tomake liquid markets much more efficient the history of enrononline probably the most successful electronic energy trading system in the world todaysupports that view according to enron enrononline has succeeded in raising the number of transactions completed by each of its market makers from an averageinto last year while lowering the marginal costper transaction byover the twoyear period however the markets that enrononline predominantly serves are two of the most liquid and homogeneous in the energy businessnatural gas and electricity moreover the exchange has achieved its efficiency gains using a modelvery different from any deployed byor available tomost online exchanges essentially enron has used online trading to extend and complement its existing offline trading business enron s focus remains the transaction rather than the transaction system by contrast the majority of transaction platforms for physical commoditiesare interlopers their operators assume that commodities traders are willing to depersonalize their business by having their complex transactions executed not by humans but by an electronic system that can do deals faster and more anonymously andat least in theorywith more players this assumption is a risky one largely because it is based on a buyer s perception of how marketplaces should operate it fails to take into account the concerns of physical commodity sellers andmore importantlyproducerstypically producers wish to ensure that the uptake of their commodity iscontinuous because that minimizes the volatility of the commodity s pricerelationships become allimportant under such conditionsbut relationships are hardly enhanced by electronic dealing to quote the november decemberissue of the harvard business review ``few suppliers want to be anonymous contestants in ruthless bidding wars premise i can make money selling gains in efficiency the logic underlying premiseis potentially seriously flawed for while there is no doubt that market participants are prepared to pay for more efficient services such as electronic trading the nature of the forces driving physical energy commodity markets casts doubt on whether a trading systemcan in the long term make a profit by charging pertransaction fees here s whyalthough the era of competition is just beginning it s clear that pressure on transaction fees is already downward and will remain in that direction even if the number of participants in an exchange shrinks to ahandful in the energy business the potential for efficiency gainsas a percentage of total industry costsimply is not that great for example research done for platts a division of the mcgrawhill companies new york indicates that the total potential efficiency ``pool in the oil industryis onlymillion year even if onlybusinesses were to try to carvea profitable enterprise out of such a pool each would be hardpressed to do so what s more such businesses would have an even harder time turning a profit because some of their competitors wouldn t be using a pertrade revenue model in particular sites operated by market participants such as enrononline will tend to charge nothing per trade because their business models seek to profit not from commissions on transactions but rather from the transactions themselves by implication it seems likely that an exchange will be able to make money only if its owners sell something elseclearing facilities backoffice integration or information to decisionmakers premise my site will be the best so it will capture all the market liquidity available this statementwhich essentially says that given enough marketing support a site can change the trading patterns of an industry to capture all of its liquidityis a fallacy the logical problem with the premise is clear because no one has yet developed a trading software package that is clearly superior to others what ``best site really means is ``most liquid site so the precondition for capturing ``all the liquidity is that the site must already be the most liquid site some startup exchanges have attempted to solve this problem by insisting that their participants make volume guarantees but volume guarantees conflict directly with traders focus on profits trading businesses that tell their traders to sacrifice profits for the sake of the common good are playinga risky game; if the common good means lower trading profits the traders will simply leave for greener pastures to become the ``best site then a site must somehow find a way to bootstrap its liquidity perhaps by offering substantial nonvolumerelated incentives or efficiencies to users however the paradox is that most sites revenue models depend almost exclusively on volume premise once i capture lots of liquidity i can build benchmarks this premise is the most startling andin some waysthe most flawed of the four it raises many serious questions the answers to any of which can invalidate the model worse these questions are all highly theoretical making persuasive answers even harder to come by among the questions are how much liquidity is enough do indexes volumetric averages make good physical benchmarks can a trading site benchmark with the bid offer range can a trading site generate a closeand last but not leastwhat is a benchmark anywaybenchmarks and indices a benchmark is a price or series of prices that a market s participants agree to use as the basis for determining other prices useful benchmarks are good indicators of transactable value a benchmark allows market participants to determine at what price they should buy or sell the commodity benchmarks are typically used in complex markets with multidimensional variables for arbitrage in oil for example benchmark pricing has grown up around the need to compute relative values for differing commodities across time geographical distance commodity type and the degree to which one commodity may be substituted for another it is a common error however to believe that markets should or do use their most liquidly traded commodities as benchmarks although liquidity is a major asset of benchmarks many markets use illiquid benchmarks whose othercharacteristics outweigh the liquidity advantage these include market transparency; the free and open availability of the commodity; the absence of political or partisan control of the commodity; the absence of delivery restrictions on it; and the size of the enduser market where the commodity will be consumed for example although the physical volume of dubai crude oil actually produced is tiny it nonetheless is used as a key benchmark for all of asia becauseunlike its persian gulf competitorsit is the only crude oil that has these characteristics one way to compute a commodity s benchmark price is through strict indexation the process of constructing a price marker from a volumetric average ofconcluded business however this process will have little chance of producing a useful benchmark unless the contributing volumes are high if it doesn t reflect a sufficient number of trades an index has little or no statistical validity as an indication of transactable price this represents a problem for benchmarking oil prices whether for crude orproducts of themillion barrels of crude produced worldwide each day the vast majority are sold on the longterm contract market leaving perhaps as little asto be traded ``spot in reality this figure is boosted in multiple ways primarily by transaction chainingthe repeated onselling of cargosbut even assuming threefold transaction growth as a result of electronic trading is still perilously low to be used as a valid basis for strict indexation especially considering the great diversity of crude oil specifications around the world for many crude oils the trading basisfor establishing price can be just a few transactions per month even for ``liquid benchmark crudes the basis is typically just a handful of trades per day oil markets however don t seem to care for example the settlement basis for the international petroleum exchange s brent crude oil futures contract is an index based on a smattering of physical trades taking place on the day of expiry acceptance of an indexation mechanism such as this has difficult prerequisites these include openparticipation in the mechanism the perceived existence of a ``level playing field the existence of comparative historical data and achieving ``buy in from the market s dominant players the nature of today s online exchanges makes these conditions hard to meetnot everyone uses exchanges; they may be owned by industry players; they typically have little or no historical data; their daily volume fluctuates wildly; and major players commitment to them is either fragmentary or compromised by volume commitments in today s environment the chance that an index will be able to gain market acceptance as a benchmark is extremely slim are strict volumetric indices usefulanother big question surrounding volumetric indices is how useful they are as benchmarks for physical commodities advocates of indexation argue that its statistical methodology helps eliminate market distortions caused for example by market closes in addition they argue that the alternative approach``market assessment based on human judgements about transactable pricesis too subjective to be relied on to determine benchmark prices indexation its proponents argue ``eliminates this subjectivity in practice however this argument doesn t pass the ``so whattest even if a system such as indexation succeeds in taking judgement out of the determination of market prices it cannot prevent attempts to distort the index by exploiting the ``rules on which the system is based in many markets human judgement is the only effective defense against market plays whose goal is profit not price transparency even in highly liquid marketssuch as for example the monthly natural gas market in the u s the indices generated by information companies like platts are subject tohuman review and analysis during their generation platts market specialists undertake a string of comparative tests to unearth potential distortions in reported prices whenever such distortions become apparent platts editors investigate the market further and where necessary eliminate certain trades from the assessment picture there are good reasons for their diligence a volumetric index can be manipulated by volume plays by a few players under the cloak of ``anonymous dealing by selective trading or by hedging in one marketplace and trading in another figuresandillustrate how players with exposure to a particular price on the buy side mightand actually domanipulate a volumetric index by doing lots of business early in the day when the market is rising they can skew the volumetric average for the day lower figurewhen the market is falling they reverse the pattern and shift their transactions to late inthe day again pushing the market down figurewhen players do this consistently the impact on an index can be considerable over time there are other potentially more serious problems with indices because anindex is a theoretical construct in a rapidly moving market it will manifest lagand become useless to market participants seeking the answer to the question ``at what price should i buy or sellindeed an index may even actively mislead people asking this question for example in a fast rising market an index generated over the course of one day will be significantly below the opening market price on the following day this creates the impression that prices have somehow moved overnight whereas in fact they may not have moved at all but perhaps the biggest problem with indices relates to their use in heavily interlinked markets where prices are constrained by a complex of spread and arbitrage values this description applies to most energy markets and is particularly apt for today s global physical market for oil in marketswhere spread relationships are as or more important than outright prices the process of generating averaged indices tends to generate sets of pricesthat cannot be reconciled with each other figuredepicts a dramatized version of this problem priceand priceare interdependent; here there is always acents difference between themhowever the volume pattern for the day s trade shown in the lower part of the figure is such that while pricehas very high volume early in theday pricedoes not enjoy its volume boost until later the resultcontrary to market reality the volumetric averages for priceand pricesaythat they only differ bycents other routes to price discovery so if an online trading system cannot generate a reliable benchmark from an index are there other routes to price discoveryyes two the first isto benchmark from a bidoffer range and the second is to use a close of some kind bidoffer ranges are widely used as market measurement tools by platts and others however the automated application of bidoffer ranges in pursuit of ``scientific benchmarks is fraught with difficulty what happens when there is a bid but no offeran offer but no bidwhat rules can be written to discriminate between an ``offmarket bid and an ``onmarket onehow should a system decide when a bid or offer s timing is not representative of the typical marketmost online exchanges have not even begun to answer these questions and at best offer their users a ``last bidlast offer price range that can accidentally distort their perception of the market if the two are not aligned in time or if it turns out for example that the ``last bid was actually withdrawn in response to the ``last offer some exchanges implicitly acknowledging that creating useful benchmarks isdifficult have tried to incorporate their transactions and bid offers into published benchmarks obviously they hope that their system will attractmore liquidity if it is tied to a traditional benchmark but it s safe to say that a publisher will be interested in incorporating an exchange s proprietary markers only if transaction bid offers are open and transparent can an online site benchmark from a closein theory yes but if human hands and brains intervene the process is no longer a mechanical one but rather an editorial judgement effort here too there are many obstacles oneof the biggest is that closing prices work best in two kinds of marketscompletely ``open markets in which assessments are derived by surveying all participants; and ``soleoperator marketslike futures marketswherethe traded instrument exists only on that exchange physical commodities by contrast are traded across a broad spectrum of instruments and submarkets it would be virtually impossible for the owner of a single submarketor online exchangeto assert the superiority of its close over someone else s or to build market acceptance for a price derived from a trading pool that doesn t include all players even a system used by most playersfor example the oil industry s derivativestrading intercontinental exchangewould have a hard time convincing anyone to rely exclusively on its closing prices that s not only because ``most is not the same as ``all but also because liquidity is frequentlytoo low to assure that there will in fact be a traded market to close every day what happens to the benchmark on days when no one comes out to playin conclusion it appears that price discovery may not necessarily be an emergent property of online trading systems that may be the case because the creators of most online trading systems have confused its mechanism withits function trading systems are neither new markets nor new marketplaces; they are simply new vehicles for participating in existing marketplaces a telephone is also a vehicle for participating in marketsbut no one expects their phone to be able to tell them the price of a commodity geb
