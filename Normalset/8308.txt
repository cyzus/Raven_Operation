 i finally was able to implement the new factors for power now know as project x if you have time i would like to give you a down load on the work involved the last few months cleaning things up overall var is reduced i ve included some highlights below changed correlation measure to fixed contract instead of using prompt price history extended factors out past prompt month tomonths power only previously was for prompt month only o repeating lastmonths seasonality formonths and scaled by ff vol updated jumps fromimpacts intra month books o introduced regionally correlated jumps mapped f curves to appropriate r and b curves captured gas leg in spread option captured gas leg in heat rate swaps corrected incorrect curve codes and data input relating to risk type as of septtrader old var new var dana davis east var west varcanada power totaladditionally items on our to do list for the future include smoothing of ffvol curveintroducing more factors to modelimproving correlations and decreasing var instability as an aside we are looking at trying to introduce a fast fourier transformation to improve var modeling allowing us to increase number and accuracy of simulations in closing this project could not have been completed without the help of the stephen stock s it team the power traders tanya tamarchenko jaesoo lew stacey white casey evans naveen andrews michael presley and donnie vinson i appreciate your patience i realize it has been a long haul thanks frank
