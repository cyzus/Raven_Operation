 hi jaideep my first suggestion is that you come to houston as scheduled and arranged with wharton nearlyweeks ago alternatively rely on your tiger teammates to gather information necessary to respond to the project should circumstances lead you to decide not to come for this trip please return the ticket issued to you should it make sense for you to visit enron some time in the future we can discuss arrangements at that time hope to see you soon christieforwarded by christie patrick hou ect onamjaideep singhsinghjai wharton upenn eduon pm to christie patrick enron comccsubjecthouston trip hello christie thank you for organizing the wharton trip to enron unfortunately the flight setup for tomorrow is way too early for me as i ll have to miss overhours of classes which i cannot afford to do i tried changing the time with continental and there latest flight leaves at pmwhich does not work for me smack in the middle of myhour class thus the dilemma that i find myself in is the followinga try a different flight as i can make any flight afterpm however i have no control over reservations budget etc b as it is possible to delay travel uptoyear use this ticket to come some other time sorry for this but i just saw the bookings today any suggestionsthanks jaideep
