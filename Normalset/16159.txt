 vince chonawee and tom halliburton had feedback about jacob to me tom s feedback is what he does for pros is actually too simple their socalled trading system is actually a scheduling system my impression is that jacob is good at selling himself his knowledge of finance and derivatives is very limited ziminforwarded by zimin lu hou ect onpmchonawee supatgiat enronpm tozimin lu hou ect ect cctom halliburton corp enron enron subjectjacob feedback i asked jacob two questions to check his basic knowledge he answered correctly in the optimization question so i believe that he has a good foundation on his optimization skill i have a doubt about his stochastic skill because he took only one course in stochastic processes and his previous models are simple deterministic models if we had more interview time i would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills he completely failed to answer the second question which is to check his basic risk management skill it is clear to me that he has a very weak background in finance and risk management he does not understand the relationship between a discount rate and risk he showed some weakness in annuity calculation in conclusion i feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak background in finance based on his experiences i have a doubt on his advance optimization skills such as his stochastic skill and his ability to attack a complex optimization problem i would recommend a secondround interview if he will be solving a complexoptimization problem chonawee
