default research commodities futures and swaps contractssetoff and bankruptcy publication datedec analystsabine zerarka esq new york; james penrose esq newyorkstandard poor s regularly receives inquiries on the treatment of certain types of financial contracts such as commodity swaps and commodity futurescontracts in the event of bankruptcy of one of the parties thereto thesesorts of financial contracts are often used to hedge or insure against future financial liabilities of at least one of the parties financial contracts take many forms many are executed pursuant to a master agreement which provides for amounts owed from each party to the other to be deducted or setoff so that a single amount will be owed by one party to the otheras risk transfer mechanisms financial contracts are an important source of market liquidity consequently certain special types of financial contracts have special protection under the u s bankruptcy code in general a bankruptcy filing triggers an automatic stay that restrainscreditors from taking actions against the debtor or its property as a result of the automatic stay creditors in general cannot exercise contractualremedies such as the exercise of setoff and closeout rights without the permission of the bankruptcy court because of the importance of financial contracts however congress provided that the liquidity of the swap and commodity markets would not be disrupted by the bankruptcy of participants by exempting certain qualifying financial contracts from the automatic stayin appropriate cases therefore the nonbankrupt party s contractual right to set off amounts owed to it under a particular financial contract against cash securities or other property of the bankrupt party held by or duefrom the nonbankrupt party is protected notwithstanding the bankruptcy of the counterparty business dealings of course often result in more complicated issues than can be addressed by a straightforward application of blackletter law the following are some of the questions that investors have asked about setoffand netting of liabilities under financial contractsqwhat types of financial contract can be setoff or nettedafinancial contracts that qualify as protected contracts under the code can be netted financial contracts must fall within certain definitions in the code to qualify as protected contracts the code also requires that suchcontracts must be between particular types of entities such as commodities brokers financial institutions stockbrokers etc in order for the financial contract to be protected under the code qin a situation where party a and party b have entered into several different financial contracts with each other can party a net its in the money obligations against its out of the money obligations if party b goes bankruptawith respect to financial contracts that are protected contracts under the code definitions and which by their terms permit termination and liquidation party a may terminate the contract liquidate collateral and net out any termination values pursuant to code sectionsand these rights are not subject to the automatic stay and cannot be avoidedor otherwise limited under the code or by the bankruptcy court in a reorganization or a liquidation furthermore code sectionwhich establishes the automatic stay creates specific exceptions from the stay for set off of mutual claims under commodity contracts and set off of mutual claims under swaps that constitute the set off of a claim against the debtor for a margin payment or settlement payment however the stay does apply to crossproduct setoffsswapclaims against commodity contracts claims for example for crossproduct setoffs code sectionprovides that setoff rights are not affected bybankruptcy but are subject to the automatic stay permission from the bankruptcy court therefore is necessary before party b could exercise its contractual setoff rights across different types of financial contracts setoff in other words is not automatic in these circumstances although crossproduct netting may not be protected from the automatic stay party b is still treated as a secured creditor to the extent of its setoff rights qin what circumstances could a bankruptcy court rescind a netting of swapor commodities claimagrounds for contesting setoff may include the failure of a particular financial contract to qualify as a protected contract under the code or thefailure of a particular financial contract to permit setoff qaside from any netting benefits realized by party a against party b where does party a stand with respect to amounts owed to it under the financial contract that have not been realized through setoffaafter termination liquidation and setoff party a will have an unsecured claim against party b qare payments made by a debtor prior to bankruptcy under swaps or commodity contracts at risk of being clawed back as a preferential transfer or fraudulent conveyanceagenerally no code sectionprovides that the bankruptcy trustee maynot avoid any prepetition margin or settlement payment made by or to a commodity broker forward contract merchant stockbroker financial institution or securities clearing agency; or any prepetition transfer under a swap agreement made by or to a swap participant as a preferential transfer or fraudulent conveyance except where such payments are made with actual intentto hinder delay or defraud creditors qin a situation where party b goes bankrupt and there are financial contracts between party a and party b where party b is in the money; between party b and party c where party c is in the money; and between party c and party a where party a is in the money can party c set off its payment to party a to the extent of its claim against party bano setoff in bankruptcy is only possible where mutuality exists i eone party must owe a debt to another party ; that other party must owe adebt to the first party as a result party a s claim will belong to the bankruptcy estate of party b while party c will be a general creditor of party b no setoff will be permitted in these circumstances ratingsdirect
