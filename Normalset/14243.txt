 vince you will find the most recent email exchanges below per our discussion i did sit down with christian last week to talk about a fundamental econometric approach to forward curve construction as was done for the agricultural efforts let me know how you vasant and stinson would like to proceed on this matter nelsonforwarded by nelson neale na enron onamfromchristian lebroc enron enronxgate onpm tonelson neale na enron enron ccsubjectrepetrochemical forward curves please review the curve modelk file which was built by research a few years back for plastics trading group i would like to work with you or someone in research as far as building the same model for all petrochemical products the benz curve file is what i have done so far but it is very primitive compare to the other model let me know what i need to do going forward christian original message fromneale nelson sentfriday april am tolebroc christian subjectrepetrochemical forward curves what kind of crude price volatility are you proposing to use nymex as i recall we did find some relationship between the time series price variable and one of the s d terms that you had placed in the excel worksheet there was no relationship with lagged price eitherif you don t mind please forward the data to me so that i can take a quick look at it nelson fromchristian lebroc enron enronxgate onpm tonelson neale na enron enron ccsubjectrepetrochemical forward curves for gbm i was thinking about using crude volatility unfortunately supply and demand is not a good indicator of predicting prices because of the economic complexity of processing aromatics statistically there is no relationship between utilization supply demand and price inserting time lag does not make the number any better either christian original message fromneale nelson sentthursday april pm tolebroc christian subjectrepetrochemical forward curves hi christian both mean reversion and gbm models assume that all information related to a future price may be found in the historical price the approach employed in the ag curves suggests that there may be some fundamental information related to supply and demand that impacts also drives future price a portion of the mean reversion process is actually captured with inclusion of lagged prices autoregressive component a gbm process requires some information on price volatility since there is presumably no forward future curve for the commodity of interest it is difficult to come up with historical volatility values hope it helps nelson fromchristian lebroc enron enronxgate onam tonelson neale na enron enron ccsubjectpetrochemical forward curves neslon i would like to insert mean reversion and geometric brownian motion in the linear forward curve equation you put together for me earlier this week please inform me on how to assemble the above request thanks christian original message fromlebroc christian senttuesday april pm toneale nelson subjectpetchem data filebenzene supply and demand xls filewti hu btx curves xls
