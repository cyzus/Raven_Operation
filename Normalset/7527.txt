 louise three questions issues which i d appreciate your feedback on i am planning to arrange for a meeting with gas and power originators traders tomorrow to let them know what we are planning with the topcustomers sending draft pa s and enlist their support for calls where we can leverage their relationships with the customersafter some more thought i m on the fence about sending out the pa s without names the following occurs to me sending them out on tuesday is only three days before we know what the final name will besending them out with the final name probably helps our credibilitythe pa eta is a very simple form; customers probably don t require the extra three days to review themfollowing the public release of our new buyers identity with the first release of the pa helps build a bit more excitement than otherwisei understand you are objecting to the provision which would allow us to release a customers name to another company i don t think most customers would object to this and getting the provisions in up front gives us more flexibility later can we keep this inthanks dave
