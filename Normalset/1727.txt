 All I have received a few notes about this since this one but I will try to respond to all questions here Please see below responses in REDEnron Capital Trade Resources Corp FromJane AllenToTara Rozen LON ECT ECT ccSally Beck HOU ECT ECT Brent A Price HOU ECT ECT Kim Melodick HOU ECT ECT SubjectTransitional Assignments Please note this is confidential at this point To document what we discussed by phone I met with Sally Beck and Brent Price today Fernley Dyson has a vacancy that he is attempting to fill but it may betomonths before the position is up and running To accomplish the need in the meantime Sally and Brent have agreed to share the duties as followsBrentAprilto JuneSallyJuneto AugustThey are traveling to the UK the week of and would like to schedule some time with you on either Monday afternoon or Wednesday Please let us know what is good for you I have free time on the morning of the th I will book out a room from am in HR Please let me know if this is a problem IssuesHousingThey will each be bringing their families with them Brentspouse andsmall childrenthe baby will need a crib; Sallyhusband andchildrenages andI understand that the houses which have been vacated due to returning expats have all been filled so can you have someone arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate themI think the best way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of accommodation My assistant Lisa has put a call in to a service who can help us find serviced accommodation in South Kensington Chelsea area or in Dolphin Square where we have people now who are very satisfied Is there a reason you are partial to South Kensington ChelseaWhat if we find accommodation in another nice area of London within a short commute to the officeWhen I have some options I will let you know probably on Monday ImmigrationDue to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and have made trips already I feel it would be best to apply for work permits versus using the visa waiver I have sent them the forms and requested that Brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his sometime shortly after he arrives in the UK I have informed him that he should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by AprilBrent s work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before April st but it is unlikely The way it works for this is as followsBrent will receive the work permit from us and if he is here he will have to leave the UK and enter with the work permit for it to be validated If his family are in Houston they will need to receive entry clearance in the US prior to arriving in the UK This takes approxworking days and they will require either Brent s original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates If Brent decides to bring his family with him to London prior to receiving the work permit they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of time and have a return ticket to back it up Once the permit is received the family can either travel back to Houston and submit the entry clearance visas there or they can all travel to Amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing entry clearance without a problem There is always a small element of risk in going to Amsterdam however as do not have to issue the stamps there they just do it because they are nice Work permits are arriving approxweeks from date of submission We can discuss all of this on the th TaxPlease confirm whether PAYE will need to be paid for them during the short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit PAYE is due afterdays; however if Brent and Sally are really only going to be here for approxdays I am not going to inform the Revenue that they are here If this extends beyond the set time we can look at options but the only responsiblility that Brent and Sally will have is to ensure they complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back Also as we would have to apply the treaty here we need to ensure the salary costs stay in Houston Jane have you discussed this pointBenefitsI have suggested that they remain on US domestic payroll and benefits and if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent in the US they may claim the excess on the expense report Agreed Per diemWe need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size Jane please call me to discuss I have left you a message thanks Let me know of any other issues we need to address As always I appreciate your help Jane
