 debbie this is an update on the continuing winston saga tanya identified the sections of the code that produce inefficiencies but the rest is in the winston s hands steve stock is very cooperative and takes a very rational enronfirst approach to the problem privately my concern is that the code based on tanya s report to me leaves a lot to be desired the code tends to be a very mechanical implementation of the algorithm developed without a series attempt to optimize it let s keep paddling along vinceforwarded by vince j kaminski hou ect onamfromstephen stock enron enronxgate onpm tovince j kaminski hou ect ect ccsubjectfwwinston vince just to keep you in the loop on the tanya winston issue regards steve original message fromstock stephen senttuesday january pm totamarchenko tanya subjectrewinston tanya i just checked in with the contractors here and it looks like it might be a good idea for you to spend about minutes with them to give you a guided tour of their documentation it s presented as a linked set of word documents and visio drawing with links to all the reletive parts as hyperlinks it s pretty good and i imagine it will be very usefull to you but probably requires a little introduction first please feel free to come to my office whenever it is convenient even if i m not available the guys are just outside my office and i can easily stop whatever i m doing to introduce you to the project manager regards steve original message fromtamarchenko tanya senttuesday january pm tostock stephen subjectrewinston stevewe spent aboutfruitful hours with winston last weeki pretty much understand the data flow when the code runsi also got an idea where the time is spent during the execution of the code by questioning winston i did not see any results of profiling the code winston s opinion is as i understood that he knows how much time is spent on different calculations and profiling is not easy to do so we don t need to do itbased on above i suggested possible way to reduce the time credit model takes to run and we discussed it with debbie who was going to arrange a meeting with winstonit might be useful to look at the documentation created by contractors if you have it handysend it to me please thank you tanya fromstephen stock enron enronxgate onpm totanya tamarchenko hou ect ect ccsubjectwinston tanya how s it going with codereview from your perspectivedid you manage to talk to our documentation contractorsif not would you me to arrange for them to bring you the documentation as it currently standsregards steve
