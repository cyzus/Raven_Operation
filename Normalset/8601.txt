nymex says accenture was dismissed because its work was done nymex blames many of the delays on globalview software one of its technology partners with which it is involved in a bitter legal dispute in april nymex filed a breach of contract lawsuit in a new york court against globalview alleging that the chicagobased software firm had stopped work on enymex and seeking unspecified damages globalview chief executive jon olson admits that his company did indeed stop work but says it was because nymex stopped paying it is countersuing seeking aroundmillion for fees and damages nymex president bo collins is also claiming that globalview has gone bankrupt but olson says business is good for the yearold company which has aroundclients in the energy industry with globalview off the project nymex has decided it will build the frontend piece of enymexthe part that globalview was working on when it s all complete nymex will have an etrade platform for derivatives and smaller futures contracts and a separate etrade service for its afterhours customers it will also have its existing pittraded contracts which it has no intention of ditching with so many different pieces some observers wonder what nymex is up to collins a onetime natural gas trader at usbased el paso responds that nymex aims to build an electronic cloud around its successful pit contracts rather than disrupt a successful business collins says the exchange is creating new electronic trading opportunities around its pittraded products the reality is we have a system of pit trading that provides immense liquidity to the market he says so i have got to figure out a way to marry the technology to the humanness of the process for example nymex s henry hub natural gas futures contract is successful and several types of contracts trade on other exchanges based on the henry hub price that s where enymex will come in collins saysthe etrade platform will offer spread and basis swaps contracts based on prices of nymex s pit contractsthus marrying technology and the trading pit some observers suggest that the enymex rollout has taken a back seat to the exchange s newest product a brent crude oil futures contract challenging the ipe the new contract which started trading on sepwas joined the following day by a new brent options contract on septhe new york exchange started offering a brentwti spread options contract the battle for the hearts and minds of brent traders will rage in the traditional trading pits of new york and london for another year at least but over the nextmonths all of the ipe s business will be shifted online to a futures trading platform being built by ice the ipe s strategy is clear by agreeing to be acquired by ice the london exchange obviously sees a future where commodities trading takes place in cyberspacenot in a trading pit nymex is betting that its electronic cloud strategywhereby etrade is married with pit tradingwill pay off in the end though the etrade versus pit trade battle being waged by the world s two biggest oil futures exchanges may become secondary to the battle for brent if nymex can create liquidity in its new brent contract its bumpy path toward etrade may be forgotten by jeff gosmano houston folder namee nymex relevance score on scale ofto review or revise your folder visithttpwww djinteractive comor contact dow jones customer service by email at custom news bis dowjones com or by phone atoutside the u s and canada callor contact your local sales representative copyright cdow jones company inc all rights reserved
