 Just wanted to let you know a few updates We have a full IT team now ready to go We are going to prototype the first window Market Penetration The prototype will give us something with sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on functionality Hopefully we will have something inweeksThe previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from the prototype The estimates areM for phase I andM for remaining phasesIncluded in the cost estimate is a figure of K for the purchase of customer prospect data from Dun Bradstreet The K is an O M expense amount that was not included in thebudget This amount combined with other amounts ENA did budget for or will spend with D B results in an overall budget impact over the nextmonths of K I spoke with George Wasaff in Strategic Sourcing this morning at the request of Philippe Bibi George has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from D B Either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with D B This could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready to go for implementation I believe I can give George some time to try something but when it comes down to it K isn t that much money Therefore I suggest that if we don t have anything negotiated in the next three weeks we sign the current proposal from D B and move forward D B is currently threatening a negotiation tactic I think to pull their development resources off of this project until they receive a signed agreement In the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our delivery of Global Entelligence we can provide a letter of intent to keep them moving or sign the proposal at that time Give me a call atif you have any comments on any of the above items
