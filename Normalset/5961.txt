 for ringsandall pjm i noticed that there is an inconsistency betweenthe term section which refers to central prevailing time andthe scheduling section which refers to eastern prevailing time working under the assumption that the term for pjm is supposed to refer to eastern prevailing time i changed the term section of ring h to ept to match the scheduling section i suggest we check with melissa murphy tomorrow to confirm the correct time zone for the term section of pjm so that we can make appropriate correctionseither to ring h or to ringsandsteve
