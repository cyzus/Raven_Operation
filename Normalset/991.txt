 Sally Angela Sprock forwarded your VM to me regarding the VAR training that you were looking to set up for your group I ve taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them about the request and their availability As well as discussing putting on theday course solely for you group I also discussed with them the possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter modules Although they considered this they are insistent that the course structure the activities and the content lend themselves better to theday format They are a very busy company in much demand both within Enron and other companies Their earliest available dates areSeptemberand SeptemberAlternatively they have more flexibility on dates later in the year October onwardsbut that may be less of a fit How does this fit with your groupLet me know if you want to discuss this further Tim
