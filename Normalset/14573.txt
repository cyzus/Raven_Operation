 vince and stinson i did some reserach on the option visualization here is one of the findings check this web site the image looks impressivehttphome online noespehaug virtualworld virtualoptionworld html this is done through a free software livegraphicsd and mathematica take a look of the demo on the web site mentioned above to see if it is goodenough for our purpose zimin ps what is livegraphicsdlivegraphicsd is a noncommercial java applet to display and rotate threedimensional graphics produced by mathematica in html pages it may be used without charge for any noncommercial purposes mathematica is a program for symbolic and numeric mathematics by wolfram research inc wolfram research is also responsible for licensing livegraphicsd for commercial purposes livegraphicsd enables all mathematica users to put almost any threedimensional graphics computed by mathematica directly onto a html page such that everyone with a web browser supporting java e g communicator or internet explorer or higher can view and interactively rotate the graphics without any additional software additionally livegraphicsd is able to show animations calculate stereo graphics integrate hyperlinks and display bitmap backgroundsf
