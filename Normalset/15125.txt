 vince i have a simplified version of brad s model in mind the no arbitrage condition equates trading margins across the country costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network wellhead supply is almost completely price elastic while burnertip demand is almost completely price inelastic storage is rationalized as a perpetual call option the least timevariant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing gas from storage to the pipeline followed by the costs of delivering gas from the wellhead to the pipeline the intermediatevariant parameters are the capacitydependent costs paid to the pipeline above shrinkage for transmission the most timevariant parameters are the trading margins and the valuations of the storage option there areparameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork they are identifiable in either of two straightforward waysusing a short time series of the lastdays prices based on the assumed variability mentioned above or pointestimates calibrations using only today s data based on a nodebased model of competition between pipelines where pipes with the same region of origination albeit markedly different terminus price versus capacity similarly competing for outflows i will write this up for you in scientific word and present it to you at your earliest convenience clayton
