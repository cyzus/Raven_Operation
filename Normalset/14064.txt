williams iii bill nonprivileged pst good afternoon ron we just had a meeting with bill williams head of realtime trading in portland to discuss some problems we are having with the realtime deals flowing to the deal confirmation system currently the deal confirmation system is pulling the term information so that changes made by realtime to reflect actual volumetric flow price are not seen by the confirmation groups one possible solution has already been examined and that would be to have the realtime traders use deal entry to make all the changes this solution will not work if the realtime guys start changing the deals in deal entry the original negotiated deal will be lost also and more importantly the time to make all the changes for the realtime adjustments in deal entry would make it impossible to keep up with the high volume of deals we are now seeing thanks david poston it manager portland
