williams iii bill nonprivileged pst according to this article morgan stanley now controls about onethird of the southern intertie s total northbound capacity or about megawatts until februarythen its share drops to just overmegawatts until marchsch wall street joins the energy players by les blumenthal bee washington bureau published june washingtonwall street s interest in the west coast electricity crisis extends far beyond trading energy futures in some manhattan skyscraper or arranging financing for muchneeded generating plants morgan stanley which earned more than billion last year has quietly purchased a major share of one of the bonneville power administration s huge transmission lines that link california with the pacific northwest themillion deal caught bonneville off guard and has sparked concern among regional utility executives and lawmakers on capitol hill morgan stanley officials said they would use their capacity on the socalled intertie to ship power purchased in the southwest for sale to utilities in washington state and oregon although most of the attention in the western power crisis has focused on major energy companies from texas and other southern states morgan stanley ranks among thelargest power marketers in the nation according to reports filed with the federal energy regulatory commission morgan stanley registered as a power marketer with federal regulators inthe first wall street firm to take such a step merrill lynch also is registered with the commission wall street firms have long played a role in the trading of commodities including energy said judy hitchen a morgan stanley spokeswoman in new york but many in the utility industry said they hadn t realized morgan stanley was buying and selling electricity for actual sale and not just engaging in electronic trading i wasn t aware of it mark crisson superintendent of tacoma power said of morgan stanley s purchase of capacity on the intertie it shows how things are changing and in congress rep peter defazio dore said morgan stanley s direct involvement in west coast electricity markets wasn t all that surprising it s wonderfully lucrative for a few folks defazio said this is the big new game it s the new world of deregulated energy bonneville has four major transmission lines linking california and the northwest capable of carrying enough electricity to power almost seven cities the size of seattle the lines were built by the federal government are operated by the transmission arm of bpa and soon may be turned over to an independent operator to quiet utility fears that bonneville could hog the region s power grid morgan stanley now controls about onethird of the lines total northbound capacity or about megawatts until februarythen its share drops to just overmegawatts until marchbpa and several other utilities own the rest of the capacity they sent us a fax telling us they wanted to buy capacity on such and such a date and ending on such and such a date said shepard buchanan a spokesman for bpa s transmission side no one had ever made a longterm purchase of that transmission path before it had never come up before under federal regulation bpa had no choice but to accept the morgan stanley bid the transmission lines act like huge spigots that can be turned off and on depending on demand though federal regulations prohibit manipulating the lines for profit theoretically the company that controls the spigot has a huge say in the market buchanan said bonneville would be keeping a close watch on morgan stanley we are concerned he said we don t want anyone gaming the market by controlling the transmission system we will keep a close eye on morgan stanley and others although not a secret the deal was finalized in early january and since then has been accompanied by little public notice we purchase transmission capacity from time to time to help us meet our delivery obligations hitchen said in response to written questions morgan stanley s internet site and annual report make only passing mention of its power marketing commodity trading revenues rosepercent to a record level in fiscalprimarily driven by higher revenues from certain energyrelated products including electricity natural gas and crude oil the company s annual report said increases in energy prices were primarily attributable to strong demand for energy products relatively low inventory and reduced production values morgan stanley officials are quick to deny they have any intent to manipulate the market saying that though it may be required to sell any capacity on the intertie it doesn t use to other power marketers federal regulations prohibit it from making a profit on such sales we have also offered capacity for resale to third parties hitchen said others remain skeptical bonneville s powermarketing arm also has expressed unease with the morgan stanley contract bonneville sells aboutpercent of the wholesale electricity in the northwest most of it lowcost hydropower generated at thefederal dams on the columbia and snake rivers it also controls aboutpercent of the region s electric transmission grid crisson said he also was concerned about a possible conflict of interest because morgan stanley and other wall street firms help arrange financing for new generating plants it doesn t surprise me a lot that they are marketing power he said they are capitalists but they need to be careful because they underwrite debt equity for utilities
