cera com client nag alt nag alt ab html western markets disconnect the western energy markets are currently in a pricing crisis power supply shortages and threats of system blackouts have resurfaced this winter in california and spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy headache for the west gas prices along the pacific corridor from kingsgate in the north to topock in the south have jumped to over per mmbtu during december after averaging over per mmbtu through the second half of november extreme weather strong power demand for gas and unusually low gas storage levels have combined to intensify the demand for pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor the result is prices that dramatically disconnected from the rest of the north american gas market in a way that is more typical of northeast markets during the winter the vulnerability to additional spikes will endure as the demand drivers combined with weakened storage inventories will maintain price pressure on western price points throughout the winter however the recent jumps in western gas market differentialsto more than aper mmbtu premium to the henry hubshould ease somewhat with a break in the weather under any weather scenario spikes up into the per mmbtu range will be a feature of winter markets along the west coast on balance we expect west coast price differentials to average at a per mmbtu premium through winter the spring hydroelectric runoff season should offer the first opportunity for a break in differentials that could drop back to more typical levels of less than per mmbtu over the long term increased pipeline capacity and additional gas supply are needed to break the vulnerability to future west coast price spikes however significant new capacity additions are stilltomonths away in the meantimeparticularly this wintersustained high and volatile price differentials and extremely high absolute prices at western points are likely to draw the increased attention of state regulators and the ferc as winter heating demand exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the crisis building up to the price spike the first signs of natural gas price spikes and disconnects emerged this summer as sharp yearoveryear increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to new highs as pipeline capacity constraints into california became evident differentials in southern california moved up to a per mmbtu premium to the henry hub these extremely high prices as well as low forward spreads discouraged storage injections through the summer as a result a strong storage position early in the summer deteriorated rapidly from may through july in august a lateral on el paso s southern system exploded; the accident further limited pipeline capacity into california for a twoweek period during that time the market drew heavily on storage inventories and further weakened storage positions as hydroelectric generation declined through the summer the price strength extended into northern california malin which had been pricing near parity with the henry hub in the summer began trading at a per mmbtu premium to the henry hub in september the summer and early fall market set the stage for continued and more intense spikes this winter the following factors are now driving this marketcontinuing surges in gas demand gas demand levels have remained high since early summer driven by higher overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric output demand levels for the third quarter in the us west averaged billion cubic feet bcf per day up from bcf per day during the third quarterpersistently strong gasfired generation production through the fall months diverted gas to power production frustrating efforts to fill storage this pressure will continue the yearoveryear demand increases from the power sector will be compounded as evidenced in november by swings upward in residential and commercial heating demand ofmillion cubic feet mmcf per day overall cera expects nearly bcf per day of increased demand in the west this winter with the critical california and pacific northwest regions showing bcf per day of increased demand key power sector drivers including the strong economy colder weather and lower hydroelectric generation will continue to push gasfired generation pipeline utilization nears capacity strong western demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western pipes to high levels flows from british columbia into the northwest pipeline have remained at high levels since summer while flows from the rockies on northwest have remained at pipeline capacity flows on pgt into kingsgate have remained at or near capacity although approximatelymmcf per day of excess capacity exists on pgt into california at malin likewise flows out of the rockies on kern river pipeline have consistently remained at capacity the only slack pipeline capacity remaining for west coast gas markets has been on southwest pipes during the past few months these pipelines have operated at their highest utilization rates since the addition of capacity from canada early last decade the high utilization of western pipeline capacityreminiscent of power plant capacity constraints that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the west this summerleaves very little slack capacity to provide a relief valve for demand spikes and that is exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks see figuregiven the level of storage inventories and expected gas demand flows on the el paso and transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher flow levels from december through march than they have averaged through november deteriorating storage position at the start of november california storage inventories held atbcf a fullbcf below the fiveyear average inventory level the strong instate withdrawals during november weakened that position tobcf; the deficit swelled tobcf inventories in california have never fallen belowbcf so deliverability through the end of winter is likely less thanmmcf per day storage inventories in california are so low that utilities ability to balance withdrawals from storage with purchases from demandsensitive price points is severely limited if the cold weather blast anticipated for mid december materializes this effort at balance will be even further compromised for the remainder of winter see figureshortterm contracting a significant amount of western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market a shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline capacity to spot transactionsin many cases in response to gas and power industry deregulationhas left the west much more exposed to spot market volatility in other areas of the country utilities have significant firm pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the citygate and or have forward purchased gas at previous and lower prices for at least some portion of their winter supplies as a result unlike in eastern markets a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of california utilities will be exposed to the current price spikes no alternatives a lack of fuelswitching capability prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas prices power prices continue to move in lockstep with the increase in gas prices not surprisingly gas prices pushed the cost of gasfired generation beyond the federal energy regulatory commission s ferc s proposed price cap ofper megawatthour setting the stage for a reassessment of this price limit a small and declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel capable significantly air emissions restrictions already plaguing power markets with much higher emissions credit costs this yearwill make any further switching to liquid fuels in the crucial california market highly unlikely this winter a recent meeting of the south coast air quality management district which has jurisdiction over the los angeles area concluded with no relief granted to generators running short of emissions credits market forces unite for price spikes during november the first cold weatherrelated demand spike demonstrated the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability of the western markets a cold weather system in mid november brought temperatures averagingpercent colder than normalthe temperatures actually averagedpercent colder than a normal january weekand provided the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery systems on the west coast capacity constraints on moving gas into california that appeared during the summer extended north into the pacific northwest as heating loads climbed this core demand compounded the effects of continued strong demand for gas for power generation the high power demand was the result of the intersection of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power plant outages gas demand in the us west during the last two weeks of november was boosted to approximately bcf per day driven by heating demand increases of bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage related demand increases of bcf per day these demand spikes caused buyersalready dependent on the spot marketto bid citygate prices to record high levels through the last two weeks of november and into december since demand outstripped supply prices rose dramatically at all western price points and flows of natural gas to western markets increased over high summer levels citygate prices surged beyond per mmbtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly per mmbtu for december bidweek at topock daily spot gas prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many western market regions west coast to remain disconnected through the winter although the week of novembercould prove to be the peak demand week in the west this winter cera does not expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the west coast any time soon storage inventories are so low that the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities generators which already rely heavily on the spot market for supplies are faced with a bidding war for scarce supplies colderthannormal weather would likely keep west coast prices in the per mmbtu range more normal weather would allow a slow decline from current levels of over per mmbtu down into the per mmbtu range however the storage situation and underlying demand strength mean that any return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early january this winter will prove a critical test for western gas markets and the end of the heating season will likely provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in the west coast market as heating loads diminish significantly in march and storage deliverability is no longer a critical issue premiums should retreat back into the per mmbtu range as hydroelectric generation begins to increase the pressure could subside even further but storage injections during the spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines even during the spring the unique vulnerability of the pacific northwest the west coast price pressure is not limited to california high demand in the pacific northwest and more indirectly in california will keep upward pressure on prices from sumas to stanfield northwest pipeline capacity from the rockies was already fully utilized at the onset of the cold weather and even so can only provide gas so far into the pacific northwest the combined california and pacific northwest demand pushed stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are bidirectional there the only supply source for the load centers in southern british columbia and even more so in northern pacific northwest such as seattle are from westcoast at sumas the westcoast mainline from the producing fields in northeast british columbia has also been operating at capacity the same bidding forces felt in california have been evident at these western canadian price points pushing sumas prices into the s per mmbtu these forces will persist keeping sumas at a premium to aeco over the winterand in much closer relationship to california prices customer responseanother log on the backlash bonfire with power plants and gas utilities paying the current high spot prices consumers bills from vancouver to san diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity prices the gas industry has been preparing for rate shock this winter warning regulators and customers alike however the price spikes in the west and the sustained premiums in western markets move beyond alarming capacity holders are reaping significant rewards for their investments in capacity positions resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from consumers to capacity holders market power and market gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will find easy application in their gas market counterpart no matter what their merits some level of investigation into the natural gas markets during or following this challenging winter should be expected as has occurred in the power markets this will now turn attention to gas purchasing practices particularly in california the likely outcome of this process will be a shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases toward a more flexible portfolio approach end follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated graphics
