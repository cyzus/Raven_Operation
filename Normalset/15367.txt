indias managing director k wade cline and dpcpresident ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice and transfernotices to mseb following wednesdays dpc board meeting in london the essence of the message from the international lenders following thelondon meeting with dpc board isemotions do not work contractualobligations and payments have to be met we are convinced that the mseb hasfailed to meet its obligations there is no point in enron continuing withthe project and the company should get out of it the structuring of dpcsdebt has created two classes of lenders in phasei international lendersare covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phaseii no lender is however all lenders have a parri passu charge making attachment of assetsamessy affair sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders tophaseii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affecttheir interests more given that they have no security other than assets like a sovereign cover it was this desperation that made local lenderslikeidbi slash the interest rates a few months back to per cent fromper cent a leading foreign banker pointed out three points that were madeclear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders werea there are contractual obligations b mseb was not punctual in its payments todpc and c mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rscrorerebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability ofpower while local lenders led by idbi with mseb parroting the same wereof theview that the current situation is a temporary one international lenderswere steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out this isdespite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for terminationgiven to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for international bankerspointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges andprotection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrappedin its present form the points of contention area that phasei of dpc isbacked by a sovereign guarantee b phaseii is not and c to the extent thatphaseii is covered by assets cancellation of phaseii may see all assets even those under phasei getting attached therefore an examination on thesegregation of assets under phasei and phaseii is now warranted pti addsin a significant move dpc

notice could enable dabhol tosuspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes while a preliminarytermination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead tothe abandonment of the project by enron analysts have described the decisionas a proceduralmove consistent with dpcs negotiating strategy torecover overdue payments from the mseb after the company issues the preliminary

inlondon mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly threateningtoissue variousarbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa inisolation in recent weeks dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with themseb delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra a steptypically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a warcoup or a similar radical political event in this case dpcs move wasviewed as a threat to stop providing electricity dpc has come under firebecause of the relatively high cost of its power critics object to thecompany charging rs a

enronsponsored dabhol power company which last nightauthorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its powerpurchase agreement ppa with the maharashtra state electricity board hasdecided to keep a stiff upper lip this in turn has stoked speculation thatthe switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent while inreality a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu ``it is not sudden deathof the project and in all probability the dpc vexed with thedevelopments including sharp and pointed observations by the godbolecommittee has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option ``this wouldonly eventually come into effect it is not an overnight operation and a lotof legal work is involved apparently the dpc intends to do somearmtwisting at the board of directors meeting in london which maharashtra was initiallydisinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentionson the project the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that theoffer of renegotiation had come rather ``too late it also said it did notsee any room for optimism about the outcome it did not however rule outthe option of talks thus underscoring the possibility that the decision toauthorise termination was a new weapon the maharashtra chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh had hoped that dpcwould not take any ``harsh step which would cause lot of damage to theinterests of both the independent power producer and the government and todayhe expressed his dismay in fact the mandate of the team that went on thestrength of its stake in the dpc was to put across the idea that negotiationwas the requirement and not confrontation echo in lsthe enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power ministermr suresh prabhu said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centrers crores whose liability in the project agreement was limited thecentre s liability in case of termination is one year s electricity bill anda termination fee ofmillion blow to fisthe termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financialinstitutions fis which under the

centre or the state the times of india fridayaprilenron ready to pull out but lenders say waitthe dabhol power company board which met on wednesday in london authorisedthe company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra stateelectricity board the company however may not pull out of the project yet considering its lenders who met on monday opposed such a move and favouredrenegotiations sources present during both the meetings said that thoughforeign lenders supported enron on the termination issue domestic financialinstitutions led by the industrial development bank of india prevailed overthe deliberations to oppose any such drastic move enron needs the lenders consent to file a pretermination notice for pulling out from the project the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination noticewas taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such amove another significant development during the entire proceedings was that thefinancial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of theproject will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms institutions are yet to disburse aboutper cent of the sanctioned package which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project ``the boardhas given powers to wade cline to issue a pretermination notice but themeeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate theproject but to initiate serious renegotiation proceedings said msebchairman vinay bansal who attended the board meeting ``mseb presented theirviews to the board members and it was understood by enron which also includedthe rscrore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings``we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite highand a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable bansal added ``they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since ourexposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve anyplans in that direction said a top banker who was present during thelenders meet ``there is a general consensus that the project must becompleted and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance he added the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank credit suisse first boston abnamro citibank and the state bank of india where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the companyofficials however some bankers said the company can file a terminationnotice even if one lender with a minimumper cent exposure on the projectfavours such proceedings meanwhile in a clear reversal of roles maharashtra chief minister vilasraodeshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa``we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since thatwould be bad news for all of us including dpc deshmukh said deshmukh wasechoing union power minister suresh prabhu s sentiments who said that thegovernment wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row he however added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments anddismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the billion project wouldbe a blow to india s efforts to woo foreign investors the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and threearbitration notices on the state government over nonpayment of duesamounting to rscrore and interest towards the bills due for december and januarymeanwhile mseb officials said in mumbai that

ministervilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board s decision asunfortunate we have already requested the company not to take any harshdecision mr deshmukh said in mumbai official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board sdecision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force themseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay through itstough posture the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it canformally agree for renegotiations with the mseb the centre and the stategovernment for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the stateelectricity board the sources said that the dpc s reported decision toauthorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb didnot mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrappingof the power contract with the mseb if anything the dpc s reported decision is to mount additional pressure onthe mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a strongerposition in settling its dispute with the mseb as part of its plan to armitself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond itscontrol the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb the centre and the state government the sources said not surprisingly thedpc s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government sdecision to set

with a rs crore protest paymentby the cashstrappedpower board as part of the march bill worth rs crore there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempersat enrons hub in houston and because it was rattled by the sudden turnofevents in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head msebofficials brushed away the allusions saying the cheque was ready

yesterdayin london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra stateelectricity board mr vinay bansal while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything it is learnt that mseb wasitself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days beforethe meeting mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congressparty president mr sharad pawar and union power minister mr suresh prabhuwho had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister mr vilasraodeshmukh and an mseb delegation last monday the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centreis ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour itscounterguarantee further the dpc has already slapped a notice of politicalforce majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event ofexigencies that force it to take an extreme step the union power minister mrsuresh prabhu contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only percent of the total energy output of the country its termination would nothave such a phenomenal impact on the power situation however if terminations proceedings go through enron corp aper centshareholder in the dabhol power company would stand to net a hefty amountin damages the union power secretary has been quoted as saying thattermination of the dpc would cost the centre rs crore which is thetotal of one yearselectricity bill and a termination fee ofmillion according to an energy analyst mr pradyumna kaul the total liability wouldnot cross rscrore however mr prabhu said in the

present the notice was prepared over the past weekendand taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu onapril however the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough givenits huge stake in the project and that such a notice would not be necessary the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff with enrons consent among those present at the london meeting were mr lal mr bansal and msebtechnical director mr p paunikar in their capacity as directors however they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party theonly vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is alsorepresented on the board it is learnt the chief minister mr vilasraodeshmukh said the state was not in favour of terminating the project thiscould mean that the latest manoeuvre to armtwist the indian authoritiescould achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated overthe past three months cleared the mseb owes enron rs crore for march and rscrore for decemberand januarythe centre today putup a brave face on enrons decision saying there would not be any adverseeffect on foreign investment in power sector in the

power project by hubert vazthe us power giant enron power corporation s willingness to wrap up thedabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise though the dabhol power company chief mr wade cline has been authorised todo so since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in thematter disclosing this chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning thatthe state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the powerproject at dabhol could be continued and at the same time enron did not feelslighted enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision we arewaiting for their letter he said when asked what sort of compromise thestate government plans to forge mr deshmukh said let our officers comeback after that we will decide a future course of action but we aredefinitely going in for renegotiation of the project it is very difficult topredict the outcome of enron s decision but as of now the project is stillon when asked whether the project could be moved to another state if woundup from maharashtra mr deshmukh said that was not possible as per theterms of the agreement between the us company and the state government however it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself heindicated he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable lossesif the project was terminated the board of directors of the dabhol power company which met in london onwednesday decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the projectonce and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project if hedeemed it fit however this decision as of now does not necessarilyindicate the death knell for the project the enron project which had beenriddled with controversies right from its inception had been a pretext forthe political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time totime the previous senabjp government which had been out to terminate theproject however chose to continue
