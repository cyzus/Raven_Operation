 FYIOriginal Message FromPhilipson Fred SentTuesday March PM ToScribner James; Segura Stephanie; Eichmann Marc CcJafry Rahil SubjectWorking together on the valuation model All As we go forward on the next revision of the valuation model due late next week or early the next for the offsite it is important that we all understand and embrace some basic ground rules I ve got some suggestions below and would like to hear any that you haveIn order to maintain coordination and control of the informationfor the betterment of us allI think we ought to give one person version control responsibility over the model This person should be advised when the model is updated Relating things like the effects on the valuation and reasons for the updating also seem pertinent Version control is critical if we are to maintain consistency in our approach to upper management Related to this Rahil should be made aware when the model is distributed to upper management both Sally and Greg and be given the opportunity to give feedback before hand Just basic stuff but if we can all agree to maintain this protocol before we go much further we should be able to avoid any unnecessary complications Thanks Fred
