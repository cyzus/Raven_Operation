 i sympathize with your desire to obtain incremental revenues but i think pnm s representation to its own system shippers might have made that task more difficult i fielded a call from carla johnson with conoco indicating that in its recent open season for this capacity pnm told parties that it wasn t really relevant whether a shipper had primary firm take away on tw from the point what really mattered is whether the shipper had firm on pnm in order to get it there this issue surfaced when i told carla that all of the firm takeaway receipt point capacity had already been taken the point here is that we might have shippers successfully using alt receipt rights under existing contracts at discounted rates to receive firm gas off pnm if pnm controls the upstream capacity then effectively they dictate the downstream parties rights this poses little to no risk to easteast shippers more risk of getting cut to the eastwest shippers lorraine lindbergpm tomartha cormier et s enron enron darrell schoolcraft et s enron enron perry frazier et s enron enron cctk lohman et s enron enron jeffery fawcett et s enron enron kevin hyatt michelle lokay et s enron enron subjectrio puerco pnm is setting additional compression at rio puerco which will allow them to flow an incremental mmbtu d to transwestern effectivein marketing this incremental point capacity we expect to receive incremental revenue from shippers who request rio puerco as a primary point michelle and perrywhen you receive a shipper request for rio puerco capacity please get approval from one of the tw marketers before approving the request perrymake the adjustment to the point capacity at rio puerco effectivedarrellplease adjust the point capacity on the posted capacity reports as well as the point capacity in the system please call me if you have any questions thanks lorraine
