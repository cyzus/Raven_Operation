energy and trading powerhouse enron corp is starting to show some scratches as negative events over the past few months from india to its broadband unit begin to take their toll analysts say make no mistake wall street still sees the houstonbased giant as the energy convergence sector leader analysts polled by thomson financial first call still believe enron will meet its earnings per share targets of forbut the stock has dropped to its lowest levels since latea slide which started with news that enron s keystone broadband content deal with blockbuster inc had fallen apart the stock had traded in the mid s as recently as february before the stock market s recent collapse and a string of negative news on friday it traded at on the new york stock exchange down cents or percent and well off its high of last august their share price hasn t been bulletproof and that s what counts they were up pushingand they re now in the s while the energy sector has done quite well so they have underperformed quite a bit and that doesn t seem bulletproof to me analyst andre meade of commerzbank securities said meade said the price fall came as investors took the bad news out of enron s valuation particularly in devaluing the broadband business with broadband the market initially gave them full credit but investors got smart over the next year and once you got some bad news out there you could argue that valuation was pulled meade said but the bad news neither starts nor ends there the latest negative item came wednesday when a california federal judge ordered enron to return the university of california and california state university systems to direct power access which enron says will cost themmillion a month the universities lawsuit which claimed enron energy services breached their power management contract could cast a shadow over the houstonbased company s power risk management arm which recently saw a huge upsurge in business involving similar multimillion

force majeure is an event beyond the control of a contractual party that could not have been prevented it s one of the steps in the process of protecting our rights it s one step but it s not the only step enron spokesman john ambler said enron has already invoked payment guarantees from the indian national government but it has refused to cover mseb s million december bill until enron and mseb

broadband services ebs the cuttingedge unit that encompasses a nascent bandwidth trading operation and a broadband content services business most recently enron has had to answer questions about a reduction in the number of employees at ebs because of the stock market s faltering confidence in telecoms generally two weeks ago the company characterized word of layoffs at the broadband unit as nothing more than an internal redeployment of staff to areas that were growing at a higher rate it s word games initially they said they were redeploying and that was not the word i heard from inside the company but that was the way they put it it s probably a little of both said analyst john olson of houston investment house sanders morris harris ebs spokeswoman kelly kimberly on monday saidemployees were leaving the broadband unit to work in other areas of the company most of them have elected to go into the redeployment pool or are already moved into corporate or another business kimberly said kimberly did not have an exact figure on the number who have opted to take a severance package but characterized it as a small percentage it has been a rough few weeks for ebs which also suffered from the blockbuster debacle last month the two announced a mutual end to a year exclusive video ondemand deal which had been considered a cornerstone of ebs content services push folder
