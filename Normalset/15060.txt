 chonawee as i have pointed out shortselling the stock may be a bad decision because of tax implications ignoring the legal aspects suppose the strike isand you were granted an atm option you sell short atten lots one lotshares the price goes toyou losexon your short position option exercise gives you this is before taxes you pay taxes on your option income it s treated as ordinary income the tax isx you can use only of your loss against ordinary income this saves you onlyin taxes of course if you have capital gains you can use losses on your option position as an offset the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time less the time value of money assuming you have income in the future or capital gains not so good by the way valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem vince chonawee supatgiat enronam tostinson gibner hou ect ect vince j kaminski hou ect ect ccsubjectshortsell vs exercise below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere it explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised but cannot be sold as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call option before its maturity however after taking vince s comments on the ordinary income capital loss tax offsetting issue i think this is not a good article anymore i guess i could just throw this article away chonawee shortselling is better than exercising your employee stock options in general the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low in fact when exercising the options you are speculating that ene would never reach this point plus interest again during theyears maturity date or until you leave the company if you do not anticipate that you should hold on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your exercise however if you believe that ene is reaching its peak then instead of exercising the options you should shortsell or sell the stocks in that amount after shortselling when you feel that the stock starts to go up you can buy them back to cover make profit and still keep the options on the other hand if the stock does not go down as expect you can exercise the options to cover your short position anytime let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes no dividends and zero riskfree rate suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as follow if you exerciseene options with a grant price ofwhen ene reachesyou would earn but if you short sellene atno matter how much ene is in the future you can exercise the options to cover the short position and still earn the advantage of shortselling comes when ene at the periodisat this point you can cover your short position get and still keep your options or you can exercise the options and gain that is you still keep the flexibility of your options when you shortsell in conclusion the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position
