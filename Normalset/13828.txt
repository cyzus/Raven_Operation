williams iii bill nonprivileged pst after slugging it out with the iso last week i think we understand the protocols for communicating with them reunit outages we need to communicate withdifferent groupsthe generation outage desk and the real time desk first we fill out an outage report and send it to the generation outage desk when the outage is over or the period of the outage changes we are required to telephone the real time outage desk that phone number is when the calls come in to real time from the iso asking about the outages they are following up on reports we have filed to see if our outage is ending as planned the services desk will be responsible for communicating with both the generation outage desk and the real time outage desk but real time should try to be aware of all outages and be able to communicate with the iso when they call services will communicate outages to real time thanks chris
