summary of a note sent to the office of the chairlast week detailing current operational difficulties with the MetalsMerchanting business Subsequently an all hands meeting was called todiscuss the operational issues and the business imperatives ofOff Balance Sheet Facility OBSF renegotiation Minimising working captial SAP implementation The notes of that meeting are also attached at the bottom of this email Should you require any further information please call otherwise I willforward updates as they are completed Regards Mike ISSUE The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet StructureOBSF pre yearend to meet Enron requirements for gearing ratios Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants these beingbearer documents it does present an issue when physical metal the value ofwhich depends upon brand and location is placed into the facility Given thehard deadline of yearend the operational support of this process initiallytook place on spreadsheets The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical businessshould not be underestimated The process of moving material off and onbalance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlements particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality inthe AS With the specified functionality it is believed that alloperational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managedsatisfactorily The core functionality which was due prior to the yearend was releasedduring January but was subsequently found to have introduced bugsto theintegrated business control processes Whilst an improvement on having noOBSF functionality the bugshave had an increasingly negative effect onthe control environment compounded by the fact that IT can not provide aguaranteed delivery for the bugfixes and non core reporting functionality This has given rise to the following concernsThere are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at abrand location level to coordination records the global position isreconciled however It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM CL asa P L on spread moves from Cash tomonths positions and related cash to months provisions can not be produced by the system and must be estimated and b System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values These concerns are compounded by the followingThe most experienced AS IT developer for the EM CL business hasresigned He is currently working hismonths notice which will expire inJulyThe most experienced AS IT developer on the EML side of the business hasalso resigned He left in JanuaryThere is no documentation for the AS It is therefore difficult forexperienced AS programmers to get upto speed on the system Conclusion It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of theAS system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays Thecurrent situation has arisen due to nondelivery of IT developments and tighttimescales on the finalisation of the OBSF facility To meet Q end requirements i e full production of the DPR and stockreconciliation IT and the OBSF deal team must make concrete commitments ondelivery timeline The business will not be able to commit to successfulimplementation of the facility and resubstantiation of the Trial Balancewithout theseForwarded by Mike Jordan LON
