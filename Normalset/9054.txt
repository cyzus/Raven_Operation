eliminatethe last minute scramble to assure that the payment is consistent with our situation in order to be eligible for payment items must appear on the weekly and daily cash flow projections failure to include on both will result in nonpayment since our payments are subject to heightened scrutiny our generalrule is that the practice of same day and manual wires will be discontinued in addition please flag any payments made to related parties as these may require separate reporting to the court any questions on this processshould be routed to george wasaff special procedures for debtors companies in bankruptcy see the attached exhibit a for a list of the current debtor companies additional companies may be added with each having its own petition date as a general rule we are legally prohibited from paying any prepetition liabilities the standard for what constitutes prepetition is were goods delivered to enron prior to december or specific petition date for entities filing after dec were services provided prior to the petition date if requests for payment are not clear the business unit must contact vendors and request them to provide an invoice signed by an officer stating what portion of the goods or services were delivered prepetitionif you are unsure or have any questions please contact george wasaff you must segregate any prepetition claims for payment in virtually all cases these claims will not appear on the cash disbursement list because we are generally prohibited from making payment however the company does have very limited authority to make payment to prepetition vendors deemed tobe critical in order for a prepetition disbursement to be approved such disbursement must make sound business and operational sense;be mission critical; andthere must not be a substitute vendor the business unit heads will be responsible for ensuring that recommendations to the committee for any disbursements to critical prepetition vendors meet this test the committee s presumption will be that a vendor is not critical if you believe that a prepetition claim clearly meets the critical test you may submit it as a clearly flagged item stating your reasons for requested payment the committee and corporate management will consider these recommendations by the business unit internal controls we need to reassess internal controls and determine if changes are requiredespecially in light of recent personnel changes all internal controls new and existing will be subject to review by andrew parsons he will be communicating with you regarding his assessment and requirements for any changes to be made i look forward to seeing you this afternoon at the meeting exhibit aenron entities that have filed filed december enron metals and commodity
