 bob sorry for the late response i ve been gone the lastdays i will not be able to make the meeting on junei do like jack dempsey s proposal i m not sure i completely understand mons reasoning but i believe the pse submission deadline should be left atminutes for the followingreasons a is very explicit in its definition of transaction start time and excluding the ramp time if we change it to readminutes prior to start that would allow a tag to be submitted atafterif theminutes verbage is to be used then the the remaining verbage defining transaction start time as excluding ramp time will need to be removed it was my understanding that both proposals intended to leave the realtime deadline at after however i still have the same questions as a few weeks ago with respect to the new bp s being put forth by the esc estf are we going to take into account the bp s that the ecs estf have put out being commented onthe schedule process bp has several ramping timing changes as well as frag tags they aren t asking whether or not we should adopt eastern connection timelines they re just doing it personally i don t think the majority of the wscc s units can handle aminute ramp and the idea of finishing the ramp on the quarter is a prelude to a perpetual time error correction and excessive inadvertent accounts however that is being proposed i would appreciate someone else s opinion on where the proposed bp s fit in with our goal carmine tilghman tucson electric power wholesale marketing
