 kevinxml namespace prefixd o nsd urn schemasmicrosoftcom office office ewc requires three clarifications to the ppa in order to get the project financed and sold all previously requested amendments proposed by the equity purchaser have been dropped and ewc will take the resulting pricing reduction i want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications arethese clarifications conform to the original deal and are not changes to the dealbanking provisions ewc and epmi agreed that energy and renewable energy credits recs produced by the indian mesa ii wind generating facility in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would on a cumulative basis offset any deficiencies of energy and recs in subsequent years section of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carryover mechanism which was contemplated by the parties this section originally provided for the carryover but in an effort to simplify the language the aggregate carryover concept was clouded both the project lenders andthe proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified there has never been a disagreement between epmi and ewc on the intention of the carryover banking provisions epmi s most recent refusal to make thisclarification now appears to be a change in the original dealgrid curtailment ewc and epmi drafted the contract with specific provisions relating to termination resulting from grid curtailment sectionthere is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covered under the termination provision relating to force majeure under sectionthis inconsistency is the problem neither ewc nor epmi were to pay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment the proposed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of the ppa be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would not give rise to termination payments this clarification is consistent with the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the dealepmi credit support epmi s obligations under the ppa are guaranteed by enron the indian mesa ii ppa permits epmi to assign the ppa to certainaffiliates without consent of the seller any assignment by epmi would not relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract and the enron guarantee would remain in place however the project lenders have required clarification that the enron guarantee would either explicitly remain in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good as enron corp s credit quality the project lender s have also requested that the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any substitute ppa used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be with a party that had a credit quality similar to enron corp s since that is the credit that is supporting the indian mesa ii ppa this will not affect the value of the contract to a third party since enron bears this obligation unless released by the project under the dispute resolution provisions of the ppa we could certainly pursue declaratory relief under arbitration our sense is that this does nothing but ensure delay from an enron perspectivethe sale of the equity and the financing of the nonrecourse debt on the indian mesa ii project is currently at a standstill due to issues surrounding the ambiguities in the ppa while the debt financing for the indian mesa i project is in place different offtaker the proposed equity sale to aep is linked to the sale of the indian mesa ii project if enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project withinthe next month enron will likely end up with approximately m less cash at year end than it counted on in its plan in addition to any decrease in planned earnings the aftertax return to enron in a hold situation isdue to enron being in the alternative minimum tax position i e it cannot use the taxbenefits it was clear in the discussions with the city of san antonio that these clarifications would have had no affect on value tod original message frompresto kevin m sentsaturday september pm tocurry mike; lamb john; payne michael; lindholm tod a ccmurphy harlan; kitchen louise subjectreamendment to im ii ppa i would like to make the message even more clear epmi will not be making any changes amendments clarifications interpretations etc to the current indian mesa ii ppa therefore any proposed purchaser of the indian mesa facility must evaluate the contract based on their own legal and commercial interpretation i don t think it is productive to spend any more time on this discussion we will continue provide enron wind with the ppa value on a daily basis such that total shareholder value is maximized for any proposed wind transaction sale of company and or sale of im project please feel free to call me to discussoriginal messagefromcurry mikesentfripmtolamb john;
