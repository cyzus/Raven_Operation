 details are still rough and the situation is very fluid but here is what is currently going onsenators hertzberg and keeley are amending both sb xx and ab xx upon an initial read it appears that they are doing the followingab xx has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the renewables portfolio the core noncore business provisions the transmission asset purchase etc all appear to have been deleted both of these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by members last week when the bill was first debated it appears amendments have been made to sb xx but the extent of these changes are not yet known at the beginning of both amended bills it states as proposed to be amended into sb xx this means that amendments to sbcould be incorporated into aband vice versa another possibility is an entirely new bill
