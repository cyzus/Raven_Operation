 hi vince i and possibly stinson as well will be attending this initial meeting looks like kickoff type of meeting i will try to attend to drill into what they can offer and what we have committed make sure that we get from the arrangement n john griebling jim irvine s perspective and ours i ll fire off additional information as i get them raviforwarded by ravi thuraisingham enron

developments following the caida members meeting onfebi ve attempted to define exactly what problem we could consider getting an ietf working group started on my summary of the existing ietf wgs with interests in metrics is given below appendix b but it seems unlikely that we could get a new ietf wg started i believe that we should instead run a single caida working group on network metrics rather than the two proposed earlier my draft of its charter is appended below it focuses on producing educational material about network measurement and on developing new metricsthese were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the caida members the wg cochairs are sue moon sprintlabs and brett watson mfn abovenet you are invited to attend the first wg meeting the agenda is as follows agenda for

being used by isps in engineering and operating their networksby customers for verifying service guaranteesb what new services are being or are likely to be offered e g diffservis there a need for higherlayer metrics to better monitor and manage these servicesc will these new differentiated transport and applicationlayer services need new metricsd how can the service metrics be measured in a multiisp environmente how can customers verify these measurementsf what requirements would service measurement introduce for equipment vendorsg how relevant are specific techniques e g which flow and points of measurement to specific users isp customer etc requirementsh how do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived by usershow do they correlate with performance appendix bbackground on the ietf working groups rtfm wgrealtime traffic flow measurement rtfm is concerned with passive measurements of twoway traffic flows specified in terms of their endpoint attributes its primary goal was to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the following needsa wider range of measurable quantities e g those relating to ipv and to class of service b simpler ways to specify flows of interest c better ways to control access to measured flow data d strong focus on data reduction capabilities e efficient hardware implementation ippm wgip performance measurement the ippm wg charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can be applied to the quality performance and reliability of internet data delivery services these metrics will be designed such that they can be performed by network operators end users or independent testing groups it is important that the metrics not represent a value judgement i e define good and bad but rather provide unbiased quantitative measures of performance rfcs framework for ip performance metrics rfcmetricsconnectivity rfconeway delay rfconeway packet loss rfcroundtrip delay rfcids bulk transfer capacity x instantaneous packet delay variation oneway loss patterns other wgs the rmonmib wg is thinking about application performance measurement this is clearly a hard problem e g does this just mean responsetime measurement can it be done by passive means how should the measurements be presented etc in shortrtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic volumesippm has concentrated
