 here is my first cut at taking the existing budget numbers to a desklevel here are the key assumptions behind my cost allocationsdirect costs for each group went to that group gas ops was allocated to houston gas power ops was allocated to east and west power based on commercial headcount most other costs were allocated to gas east power west power canada ooc based on commercial headcount there are a hundred ways you could do this exercise i m not saying that this is the right way but at least i was able to break the costs down i then calculated an ebit by desk funded a bonus pool paid bonuses to all the noncommercial people and figured out what a bonus pool would look like by desk based on the proforma values i am not necessarily saying that this is the way that we should do it but i think that it is one way to view the world upon which we can make whatever changes adjustments we deem necessary here are my initial conclusions reactionsthe proforma produces bonuses for commercial employees equal to roughlyof their gross margin this number is high relative to thewe are used to but considerably lower than thetothat appears to be available in the market our costs are way too high for every dollar of direct commercial expenses there are four dollars of allocations that just seems way out of hand this model sells with lower costs with current costs i have a hard time convincing people in portland that this looks good relative to people s alternatives i think that we need to have a lot of discussions next week on how this new organization would be managed i don t see why we couldn t debate if not nail down a bunch of things next week for examplehow do we allocate var to the best performing traders and the market that offers the best opportunity at the timedo we need to incent desk heads based on netco earnings while compensate traders based on desk earningshow will we carve up the bonus poolwhat are our choiceswhat gets the var to the right places and properly incents teamworkhow do we best manage costshow do we send appropriate cost signals for sunk costsfor variable costswe need a very strong professional operations manager who is steeped in cost accounting efficiency quality control and leadership there is a science to operations management that i haven t seen applied at enron for example what does it cost us to schedule a mwaverage and marginalwhat does it cost us to run a bookwhat does it cost us to settle transactionswhat package are we going to be able to offer to incent people to staywhen can we start talking about itwho should we discuss this withwhat does our management team look likeis it three peoplefive peopleten peoplei want to make this thing work my clear first choice foris to be on this team i want to be as contructive and helpful as possible in achieving this end i can t commit unequivically spuntil we sort out all of the numbers i feel like i can sell this to the portland team and i know what comp looks like for me and the key people in portland i feel like some adjustments to the proforma and a clear understanding ofcomp will probably get us there when do you want me in houston for a visitnot to move tim
