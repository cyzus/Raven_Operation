 i consulted with kevin before i took the oars in trying to answer your question as well as the questions raised in drew s email here s what we found out steve s questionwhat economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in new mexico maybemw and build a line to the grid in california versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in californiawhat you re really asking here is what are the comparative economics of energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipelinein this analysis there are a few considerations original capital cost to construct facilitiesthe operating cost of the facilities including energy loss andenvironmental and other permitting considerations engineers tell us that as a rule of thumb high voltage transmission lines and tower facilities cost approximately to mm mile to construct turnkey this figure is comparable to the mm mile rule of thumb we use for turnkey construction of mainline diameterhighpressure steel pipeline in terms of operating costs for anything overmiles in length there are threebasic sources of energy loss in electric transmission transformation lossradiation loss efm andheat loss across the conductors a rule of thumb for electric transmission loss isthis number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on transwestern s pipeline the most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission lines is in the area of permitting there just aren t many new transmission lines being approved it was suggested by more than one source that an electric transmission project on the order posited in your example could take anywhere fromtoyears to secure authorization the issues of electromagnetic field emf radiation around high voltage power lines along with other wildlife endangerment concerns are significant obstacles in securing permits for rightofway in short the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines the protracted permitting process for electric transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure drew s questions what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plantfor purposes of this exercise i m assuming we re talking gasfired generation developers generally describe four considerations in deciding where to site a new electric power plant market area demand distributive and or transmission access to marketwater rights for turbine coolingease of permitting environmental encroachment fed state local regulations affected agencies jurisdictionproximity to natural gas pipeline supply infrastructuredo the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilities power pools vary all that much or are ordertariffs pretty much the same all overferc orderandrequire public utilities to commit to standards of conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and between other utilities and or power pools in the various operating regions ferc ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate their transmission reliability functions from their wholesale merchant functions the rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under ferc orderaffecting interstate natural gas pipelines it s pretty obvious from the california example this past summer that with respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual states particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of independent system operators iso s there is substantial room for improvement and possible further ferc involvement in the open access final rule order nothe commission issues a single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission service all public utilities that own control or operate interstate transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro forma tariff they must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own wholesale energy sales and purchases order noalso provides for the full recovery of stranded coststhat is costs that were prudently incurred to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use open access to move to another supplierhow do ipp s decide what fuel supply strategy works best i e buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs buy gas storage transport etc separately in my experience there is no one size fits all formula or strategy for example in the past we ve seen calpine take a very handson approach to supplying its ipp projects in the mid to lates during the build out of several qf s cogens calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground and dedicated them to the project in today s market calpine has scavenged the gas and basis traders from statoil and setup a natural gas desk for the purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western u s power projects in other projects developer owners and their lenders are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply transportation to the project in short projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics and secure reliable supply by taking bids or rfp s for gas supply transportation or whether to take a more handson approach ala calpinewhat is the rto rule and why should we carelast december the ferc issued order noa final rule on regional transmission organizations rto s orderbuilds on the foundation of ordersandissued inaccording to ferc chairman jim hoecker ordermakes a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations from the influence of electricity market participants therefore ordercan be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the functional unbundling adopted in ordersandcontinuing balkanization of the electric transmission grid based on corporate not state or regional boundaries as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of privatelyowned transmission companies ferc prescribes a voluntary approach to rto participation the order initiates a regional collaborative process to foster rto formation the order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned public utilities that are subject to ferc jurisdiction and requires these private utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate the needs of transmission owning state municipal cooperative and federally owned systems ferc believes that regardless of format rto s will offer the following benefits alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused by structural changes in the industryimprove efficiencies in transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion managementimprove grid reliabilityremove remaining opportunities for discriminatory practicesimprove market performanceincrease coordination among state regulatory agenciescut transaction costsfacilitate the success of state retail access programs andfacilitate lighterhanded regulation critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility voluntary rto formation and transmission rate reforms i e incentives orderdefers for casespecific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved in order to create an operational rto moreover orderdoes not compel any transmission owner to join an rto but provides only regulatory guidance and incentives for willing participants as well as a veiled threat of further consequences for the holdouts as to the final part of the question why should we carepresumably the development of a fullyfunctioning rto network will promote both the efficiency and market transparency goals of the original ferc orders as ferc reads it the future of gasfired generation for both merchant and utility systems depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission system therefore the promise of the rto is to stimulate competition and the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure unfortunately sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the rto program may ultimately cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goalshasmmbtu gas killed the gas fired power marketnatural gas prices ofmmbtu can only kill gasfired power plants in those instances wherethere are more economical alternatives to natural gas fueldemand for electric power is offset through demand side management ornatural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly prohibited from use as a power plant fuel in the western u s marketplace particularly in california i see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel for electric power generation renewable resources currently meet less thanof the total electric resource requirementsbarrel oil prices give fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas even at ammbtu price moreover california environmental and permitting regulations make the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible while demand side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting resource needs historically they have served only a minor role in offsetting the growth in electric power as to the final point i m unable to comment on the risk of future legal regulatory restrictions governing the use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel steven harrisam tokevin hyatt et s enron enron

when we originally decided to use my staff meetings for graduate education one of the hot topics was the electric industry we all had a first lesson on this topic in shelley s electricity seminar last summer now john and kevin have graciously agreed to join us tuesday at to discuss recent developments in electric markets and nn s and tw s efforts to attract power generation load to the system specific topics i hope to cover include the following what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various
