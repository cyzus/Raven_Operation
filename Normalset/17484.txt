 ted an update on the implementation for ffvols in comparingdays of historical var calculations with that of the implied for agggas we have found that the historical var calculations are consistently lower over this period by roughlymm the implied volatilities are much higher at this period anticipating strong winter pricesat this time the consensus is not to relase the historical implementation into production and the official line to traders will be that the method is still in testing the historical var ismm and the implied ismm for effective date offurther testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology which i mentioned last week whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio of prompt to historicalprompt volatilities to atleast capture some implied forward effects tanya s analysis on a fictitious portfolio indicates higher var numbers but poorer backtesting in comparison to the historical approach this approach serves as an intermediate and seems appropriate in periods such as the current one wherein the historical numbers might be considerably lower than those of the impliedwinston will start testing using these hybrid vols and if the results are deemed satisfactory that will be the production methodology of course we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different indicators and beacons of risk the production number will hopefully be a sensible compromise of the different methods regards naveen
