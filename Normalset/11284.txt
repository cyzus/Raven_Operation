 el paso says it s open to expansion of system el paso natural gas is willing to expand its system to the california border if sufficient support for such a project can be demonstrated through longterm capacity contracts the pipeline told ferc the pipeline s comments were in response to a commission inquiry asking el paso to consider the feasibility of upgrading its proposed linecrudeoil conversion project to a system expansion to help ease the pipeline capacity crunch in the west daniel m adamson director of ferc s office of energy projects raised the prospect in a janletter to el paso saying that modifying the project could assist the difficult situation now facing the california gas market specifically the commission has recommended that el paso amend a pending application in which it seeks to acquire an existing inch diametermile crude oil pipeline from plains all american pipeline l p and convert part of it to natural gas transportation service the line extends from mccamey tx to bakersfield ca el paso plans to convert to gas service a mile segment from mccamey to ehrenberg az el paso proposed the lineproject as a loop line to replace existing compression and not as a system expansion however there are several ways that an expansion could be accomplished wrote el paso vice president al clark on janel paso could add compression to the proposed lineproject or it could replace or recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon in place as a third option he said el paso could add new compression to its existing system or loop either the existing system or lineproject the preferable method will have to be determined by a careful analysis of the relative costs and a determination of where shippers want the capacity i e where they want to put gas into el paso s system and where they want the gas delivered clark said as a first step towards gauging market support for an expansion he noted that el paso on janposted bcf d of californiabound pipeline capacity for sale effective juneof this year the capacity currently is held by affiliate el paso merchant energy whose contracts expire maywhen the posting results are known el paso will determine whether another open season is needed to solicit expressions of interest in additional pipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of california if el paso finds there is an unmet demand for additional capacity on its system the pipeline at that time will evaluate whether an expansion of the existing system or a modification of the lineproject or both is the appropriate means of accomplishing the expansion clark noted in the meantime he urged the commission to approve el paso s application for the lineproject as it was filed not only will the project increase the operational flexibility of el paso s current system but converting the line from oil to gas service will be a necessary prerequisite to any future expansion of the pipeline s system according to clark
