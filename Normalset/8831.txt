 jennifer doesn t know it yet but when i submitted final numbers to hr i kept her suggested increases and did not apply her suggested decreases which she did to balance the increases i expect we are going to lose some people i hope the ones that go are not the best ones obviously the more we are willing to spend in bonus the fewer the people we will lose when would you like to get together to discussdave original message fromkitchen louise sentmonday december am toforster david subjectfwproposed retention bonuses for netco sensitivityconfidential original message fromdenny jennifer sentfriday december am tokitchen louise subjectproposed retention bonuses for netco sensitivityconfidential louise i am sorry to bother you at such a critical time because i know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at enron and are working long tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter however i felt like i had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following dave forster i met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group i was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual i was allowed to move dollars but not allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group frankly the numbers seemed pretty low assuming the goal is to retain key employees for netco i am not confident these numbers will achieve this i know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company i have asked them to be patient not make any quick decisions and give us a chance to see this through dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations as you know mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end the mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end i understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available however because the retention numbers were based on this they are significantly lower my intentions are not to show any disrepect to dave by discussing this with you but i wanted to make sure my thoughts opinions were communicated to you if dave has already discussed this with you i apologize for the duplication if you have any questions please feel free to call me i am on holiday will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell atthank you for your time jennifer
