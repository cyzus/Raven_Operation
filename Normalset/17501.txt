 hi vince i apologise that i did not send you the following mail kirsteeeforwarded by kirstee hewitt lon ect on enron europe fromkirstee hewitttoandreas barschkis mgusa com ccbjorn hagelmann hou ect ect grant masson hou ect ect subjectvar numbers for the th hi andreas i have run the var model for the th july and have attached a zip file of the resultsthe total var isand the cu position isi have had trouble getting hold of you so i thought i would summarised what i wanted to talk about also i thought i would give your ears a rest basically it is wrt the second point in your mail yesterday we briefly discussed it earlier the fax you sent me to explain the risk calculation suggested that you use aday period of adjustment to calculate the risk in this case it is called capital at risk the var calculation for our model is for a one day holding period which means that your risk factor will be reduced by a factor equal the sqrtor since old risk factor std of the price movement new daily risk factor which actually equates to std of approx a day i am happy with this as a estimate of the vol as the annualized spot vol we are showing for cu is approxwhich equates to approx daily using this new risk factor for the daily var the cu positions would give a var for the th of approx m which is less that the figure we estimatedthe other thing is that by taking net numbers we are disregarding the term structure of the price curve vol curve and position curve and are hence collapsing everything into a one factor model which means that it is difficult to compare the numbers i hope that this helps to explain our number hopefully we can talk tomorrow cheers kirstee
