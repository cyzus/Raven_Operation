 david here are the reviews of the ut energy finance program that you requestedfrom jennifer martinez mba class ofenergy finance taken fall of the energy finance programyears ago was very good especially consideringit was the first year of the program there were a lot of guest speakersfrom various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge aboutthe energy industry through case studies lectures etc basically welearned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular financeclasses but all the cases and examples were energyrelated the professorswere good for the most part but didn t have a great deal of practicalindustry experience if i had to guess the reason for decreasedparticipation in the program i would probably say it is the professors ronn and titman are great but known as being very technical andquantitative some students prefer less technical professors and classesthat aren t limiting to the energy industry also the fact that the classmeets forhours twice a week may not be so appealing other than thosethings i can t imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment iespecially don t understand why every single person didn t drop for enron iwonder if it has something to do with international statusfrom john massey mba class ofenergy finance taken fall ofbottom lineut business schools is greatinvestment fundbest activity available tostudents energy finance programfairly weakit was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with aweak finance appendagethe finance teacher was patheticboth a poor teacher ignorant aboutindustry specific analysis devoid of industry experience rude to outsidelectures from industry keith brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a smallportion of the class timeway to make betterget teachers with practical industry experiencemake it a seminar classfocus on case studies lecturesgiven by peoplefrom industrypromote the class within the business schooli felt like ut did a poor jobof internally to students promoting the class from ross mesquita mba class ofenergy finance taken fall ofto be honest a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific when energy applications were presented it seemed more like general financequestions were reworded to include energy lingo we had some very goodspeakers but for the most part i did not feel like thehours of class hadenough energy focus i assumed that this would get better as the programprogressed one reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that energyfinance is a very specific focus i would have probably not enrolled in theenergy finance program had it been available in my first year i did notknow enough about energy at that time and i had returned to bschool toconsider several career optionsi e investment banking corporatefinance entrepreneurship marketing etc as a new mba student i would notwant to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many mbas my interest in enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versafrom billy braddock mba class ofenergy finance taken fall of i was a participant in the inaugural energy finance program in the fall of the primary positives to the class revolved around outsidepanels instruction for example enron sent representatives onseparateoccasions to discuss particular topics vince kaminski and gary hickerson other notable speakers were jeff sandefer independent business consultantand e p professional the beacon group and encap investments another goodspeaker was a professor from ut s school of engineering he brought a goodperspective as to the basics of the energy business the class was structured via a teambased instruction approach with professors teamteaching a hour credit course none of theprofessorshad any product knowledge of the energy business of theprofessors were research focussed tenured with little credibility in teaching one ofthe professors primary focus of research was fixed income while the other were investments and corporate finance respectively as is the case for ut s finance program in general and energy finance inparticular ut is in dire need of teaching professors as opposed to researchprofessors that have the ability to convey finance with practical examplesand at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without afinance background particular to the energy program ut needs to have moreinstruction from energy professionals such as the instructors used forenron s internal learning programs ie derivatives classes etcfrom bryan williams mba class ofenergy finance taken fall ofi participated in the first energy finance class offered in fall ofatthe university of texas the curriculum was understandably rough around the edgesaswas thefirst year the energy finance course was offered however the instructionalso suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speakof the credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors two of the three professors have coauthored textbooks and the thirdprofessors claim to fame is fixed income as a group the three professorsare researchheavy as opposed to industry focused and the teamteachingformat did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable forthe success of the class that said the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outsidespeakers among themvincekaminski gary hickerson both of enron they also dedicated one classperiod to a video conference call with the beacon group an energy consultinggroup that i believe was recently acquired by goldman jeff sandefer an independent businessman an entreprenuership instructor and one of the foremost experts in the e p sector also spoke to the class jeff was joined by some of the executives from houstonbased encap the woes of the energy finance could be easily remedied by injecting someinstruction from someone from industry the class is tooacademic theoretical with too few relevant examples excerpted from the energysector the instructors enron uses for the derivatives courses taught internally aregood examples of people who can package very relevant information andsuccessfully articulate it in a couple of days perhaps a similar approachwould bode well for the energy finance program at utfrom yuan tian mba class ofenergy finance taken fall ofhere are my thoughts on the ut energy finance programpros more focused on the finance studies in the energy industry which is rightnow in a transition period from regulation to deregulation and thus isexposed to different financial perspectives from the other industries;there are some experienced brandname professors e g sheridan titman teaching in the program;cons the program should give the students more exposures to energy companiessuch as enron specifically it might need to help students link to theinterview oppurtunites from these energy companies such as enron;from george huan mba class ofenergy finance taken fall ofcompanies expect mba students to have both general management new ideas andanalytic quantative skills energy industry is no exception energy finance program offers financial strategy and risk managements courseswhich fit in the insudtry need however these two courses are far fromenough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformationand excitements and opportunities in this industry other management andquantitive courses are needed to complete this program my suggestions seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies beforestudents make their decisions let them knowwhat s happening and what sgoing to happen in this industry; what the companies are doing now; whothey are looking formanagement and or analytical courses should be included such asstrategy financial enginering and real optionmore industry connections presentations and discussionsfrom charlie weldon mba class ofenergy finance taken in fall ofmy experience in the energy finance program overall was a positiveexperience the most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakersbrought in during dr titman s portion of the class this part of the courseis taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of caseclasses all focusing on the energy industry two of the cases were based onenron and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate andwell thought out value added by the professor was less than from thespeakers and cases the first eight weeks of the course covered futures and options nearly allof the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energyindustry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the student sunderstanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market the useof options and futures for speculating and or hedging was stressed onnumerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a powerplant project i believe that the university energy finance faculty are trying tocontinuously make improvements to the program however i do not believethat they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path toimprovement there is a strong need for more practical based training onenergy derivatives similar to the course taught by paradigm here at enron the focus of the university teachers is quite theoretical due in large partto their background while the theoretical basis is crucial to understandingthe basics the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effectivebridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course until measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensiveindustry experience i believe the energy finance program will continue tounderdeliver on its objectives additionally i believe that the coursestructure should be changed to eliminate the need of havingconsecutivehours of classroom instruction
