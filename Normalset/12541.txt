williams iii bill nonprivileged pst this article appears to be addressing the letter sent by steve hall via the iep to the caiso its good reading kit published thursday august group questions power payments power crisis by mike taugher contra costa timesan industry trade group asked market officials on wednesday why they have failed to pay more thanbillion for power sold during april and may for some reason the money is not getting from the ratepayers to the generators said jan smutnyjones director of the independent energy producers association our hope is that this is a temporary misunderstanding part of the answer officials said is that the state s powerbuying agency is refusing to pay its bills in full until it gets more information about who ultimately receives the cash compounding the problem is the fact that when the may bills began coming due earlier this month some market participants who were owed money from previous months credited their own accounts instead of paying in full according to the independent system operator that left the iso less able to pay its may bills said iso president and ceo terry winter in a written statement the iso acknowledges that past debt is due winter said in the statement winter said the iso would respond more fully to address questions about the underpayments by friday but in response to the iep letter he demanded that market participants quit crediting their own bills the iso runs the spot markets in california buyers and sellers make their bids through the iso which sets the market price based on those bids collects payments from the buyers and divvies them up to the sellers the issue came to a head wednesday when the iep sent a letter to the iso demanding to know why generators were not paid in full for electricity sold in april and may smutnyjones said estimates of unpaid amounts during that period ranged around billion in early april federal regulations went into effect that essentially barred the financially broke utilities from buying power in the iso market that forced the state department of water resources which began buying electricity in january to pick up the entire unmet need of the utilities customers dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo said that the state is required to compile certain information about bills it pays before it pays them we haven t been given what we feel is an adequate accounting of what we re going to be paid for hidalgo said we are working with the iso to see how we can get some of that information that we re not getting iso spokesman gregg fishman said his agency is working with the water department but that market tariffs require that some information be kept confidential we can t tell one market participant what another market participant is doing fishman said original message fromhall steve c senttuesday august pm tobelden tim; yoder christian; o neil murray p ; foster chris h ; williams iii bill; stokley chris; blair kit subjectfwletter sent to the iso on creditworthiness iep decided to send our letter to the iso inquiring about the creditworthiness of certain scs like cdwr let s see what happens steve original message frommara susan senttuesday august pm tohall steve c subjectfwletter sent to the iso on creditworthiness original message fromkatie kaplan [mailto kaplan iepa com] senttuesday august am toalan comnes email ; bill woods email ; bob ellery email ; brian t cragg email ; carolyn a baker email ; curtis hatton email ; curtis kebler email ; parquet david; dean nistetter ; douglas kerner email ; duane nelsen email ; ed wheless ; eric eisenman email ; george vaughn email ; greg blue email ; jack pigott email ; joann van buren ; joe ronan email ; john g larrea email ; ken hoffman email ; kent palmerton email ; fillinger mark; mark j smith email ; marty mcfadden email ; nam nguyen email ; rachel king ; randall j hickok email ; roger pelote email ; ross ain email ; scott sadler email ; steve ponder email ; steve schleimer email ; susan j mara email ; tom hartman email ; ward scobee email ; william hall email ccandy brown email ; carol hudson email ; jan smutnyjones email ; jean munoz email ; katie kaplan email ; sandra moseley email ; steven kelly email ; thomas r mcmorrow email subjectletter sent to the iso on creditworthiness greetingsattached please find the final letter sent to the iso on creditworthiness thank you to all who provided input and feedback on the letter thanks katie kaplan manager of state policy affairs independent energy producers association
