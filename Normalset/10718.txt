 ferc gives high sign to wi pipe competition the northern illinois and southeastern wisconsin gas transportation markets which long have been dominated by anr pipeline moved one step closer to obtaining pipelineonpipeline competition yesterday when ferc awarded the proposed guardian pipeline llc a favorable preliminary determination on nonenvironmental issues the decision was a major win for the proposed greenfield pipeline because not only did it shoot down most of the arguments presented by anr to thwart the project but it found that even though the project would adversely affect landowner interests guardian was making reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact on landowners moreover ferc ruled that while themillion pipeline would compete headtohead with anr it would not have a negative affect on the coastal pipeline and its customers on balance the commission finds that the proposed guardian pipeline will provide substantial public benefits with minimal adverse impacts the order said [cp] the commission also found that sufficient need was established for the inch mile pipeline that would transport dth d of gas from the chicago hub to markets in northern illinois and southern wisconsin providing customers there with an alternative to anr and access to competitive canadian gas supplies it would terminate near ixonia wi where it would interconnect with wisconsin gas co s distribution system at the chicago hub the pipeline proposes to interconnect to alliance pipeline northern border pipeline midwestern gas pipeline and natural gas pipeline co of america guardian has executed year precedent agreements with four shippers for dth d which equals aboutof the project s design capacity the largest shipper by far will be wisconsin gas which has committed itself to dth d of the capacity on the proposed line in fact the guardian project is an outgrowth of wisconsin gas s request for proposals rfp process in junewhich the ldc initiated in anticipation of the expiration of its firm transportation contract with anr in octoberthe other shippers on guardian include alliant energy dth d wps energy services inc dth d and an unnamed shipper dth d the project has a targeted inservice date of nov in multiple protests filed at the commission anr argued that guardian s application was patently deficient because it didn t include the proposed lateral that wisconsin gas plans to build to interconnect with guardian wisconsin gas currently is seeking the approval of state regulators to build the lateral furthermore anr claimed wisconsin gas was using its monopoly power as a franchised ldc serving southern wisconsin to subsidize the guardian project wisconsin gas s parent wicor inc is one of the sponsors of guardian the other backers are cms gas transmission and storage and viking gas transmission but ferc rejected both arguments while previous attempts to inject competition into anr s market in this area have failed we believe that this area is ripe for competition and that it is only a matter of time before other pipelines submit similar proposals to the commission we find that the proposed project will provide southeastern wisconsin with access to another source of supply which will allow this market to enjoy the benefits of pipelinetopipeline competition for the first time the order noted
