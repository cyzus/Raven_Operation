williams iii bill nonprivileged pst on sunday we had a problem with psco they tried to back out of a purchase from el paso since they claimed they were picking up the power at the fcbus instead of thebus also there is an issue with the schedule being until further this once again highlights our need to be as clear as possible on all aspects of the deals that we do all new people should have a discussion with myself or another senior member as to the differences between the fc s busses n gila vs devers and other points on the grid that you are unsure of thanks ryan
