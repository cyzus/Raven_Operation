was replaced with interim chairman robert fairweather but we do not expectfairweather to have a long tenurethe word is gordon campbell and company are seeking a replacement to fill mr smith s shoes as early as midaugust we expect key changes to occur in hydro s executive and board of directors following the appointment of the new chair although senior managementat bc hydro is relatively comfortable with the company s financial position and competitiveness they will be pursuing a strategy of expanding generation capability through new dams and oil gas exploration pending environmental approvals as a part of bc hydro s move to look for additional generating capacity they are turning to a pair of megaprojects that were scrapped a decade ago bc hydro has commissioned new technical review studies ofthe mw site c hydroelectric project near fort st john and the mwcoalfired hat creek project near kamloops in terms of a rate hearing we do not expect bc hydro to conduct a rate hearing until the new chairman is appointed it will be difficult to get rates raised although with the government budget deficit looming there will beconsiderable pressure to begin looking this direction another key revenue challenge for bc hydro will be responding to the recent price caps imposed by ferc on western power markets and potential power purchase refunds to california though their contributions are not immense they are still significant bc energy politics things have really heated up in victoria now that the new campbell administration is settling in earlier we reported that the office of the premierhad taken control of all the agencies and political staffing decisions withof theelected members of the bc legislature sources close to the premier indicate change will be fast and furious to offset any local coverage from volatile media the bc government s primary focus will be to stimulate the economy while trying to restrain government spending to thatextent they have instituted an across the boardstimulus tax cut and will have to deal with the deficit issues that that cut entails one of the ways they are looking to balance things out is to outsource crown assets and look for other areas to generate revenuenew sources of government revenue through oil and gas exploration and energy will be a top priority minister of energy and mines richard neufeld will be one of the main drivers behind the current fasttracking of the offshore oil and natural gas exploration there is a great deal of pressure on the bc liberals to balancethis budget and they will be looking at ways of delivering revenue sourcesthrough oil and gas exploration permitting as a shortterm solution neufeld has reviewed the backhouse report northern development commission regarding the need for continued local public input and has basically tossed it asidethe report had not gone far enough to please the liberals otherthings on the minister of energy s agenda oppose sumaspower project phase out burarrd

drop the review provision on the senate bill which would have opened up an additionalbillion for bpa borrowing authority if senator murray is successful the measure could have asubstantial impact on bpa financial solvency with the exception of the approximatelymillion spill over the dalles and bonneville dams bpa has already foregone a major summer spill to protectendangered salmon species representatives of four northwest governors ventured to washington dc last week to express concerns over the new hydro biop and how it will be implemented states were concerned about their lack of input in the implementation processa plan being developed by action agencies and spearheaded by bpa the plan has been put on hold pending a review headed by interior department lawyer ann klee idaho and washington representatives showed concernthat the biop could be overturned in courtthey were concerned that the nmfs underestimated the risk of extinction of snake river stocks and that it was illegal to rely on offsite mitigation to help satisfy the hydro system s esa obligations while the administration has said it plans to doublepast expenditures to implement the biop nobody at the meeting could come up with just what the previous biop costs werefor now the salmon plan is pure lip service smelter curtailments kaiserfaced with declining aluminum prices which have decreasedfrom last year kaiser is in a difficult position due to the fact that they are maintaining a level of infrastructure and personnelreadiness which will allow them to restart s lines of their operations on the fly should this curtailment last longer than a year it would be costprohibitive for them to continue incurring that infrastructure expense kaiser has gone on the record to say it is still open to signing load a curtailment agreement with bpa but it is unclear at this time whether bpa foresees a benefit in signing an agreement considering shortterm and perceived midterm electricity price decreases we are continuing to monitor this situation as it develops although an agreement in the shortterm seems doubtful alcoarecently mentioned in the press canada s newfoundland government and u s aluminum giant alcoa inc announced thursday they would conduct a feasibility study to possibly revive the stalled lower churchill hydroelectric project in the remote labrador region the generating station on gull island could produce up to mw of electricity costs of the project areestimated at some cbillion billion far below the cbillion originally thought with adrop in net income due to slackening global aluminum demand and higher energy prices alcoa has suffered along with therest of the aluminum industry to find cheaper less volatile sources of electricity along with their ongoing negotiations with bc hydro it appearsalcoa is making a determined push to work with the canadians to play all sides of a competitive electricity market forestry issues there are a number of fuel
