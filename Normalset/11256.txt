 the gpg safety declaration of interdependence signed by all gpg pipelineoperations staff is our promise to each other that safety on the job is firstbefore all other concerns that we will positively act to assure safepractices this safety advisory bulletin nois issued to reinforce theneed for personal safety at all times and in all circumstances on aprila onecall ticket was issued for the work being done adjacent toone of gpgs pipelines the ticket did not identify gpg as having facilitiesin the area so gpg was not notified sometime after aprila gpg employee observed a contractor working in thevicinity of an active pipeline the employee located and marked the pipelinein the area where the contractor was working on maythe contractor wasexcavating approximatelytofeet downstream of the marked pipeline routing a water line and uncovered a inch pipeline that was assumed to beabandoned the contractor was willing to incur the cost of removing a sectionof the abandoned pipeline if the facility owner would ensure it wasabandoned the contractor requested a onecall ticket to mark all underground facilitiesin the area of the excavated inch pipeline gpg was notified via fax ofthe line locate request the gpg employee who previously had located andmarked the pipeline informed the contractor that he was unaware of anyabandoned pipelines in the area but that he would investigate further theemployee checked his pipeline drawings and consulted with other team membersand learned that there was an abandoned pipeline in the area team membersalso informed him that the accepted practice for checking abandoned pipelineswas to drill into the pipe on maythe gpg employee entered the contractor s excavation and drilledinto what he assumed was the abandoned pipeline the employee believing theescaping medium was air decided to let the pipe vent until the pressurerelieved after two hours of venting and no noticeable reduction in pressure the employee reentered the excavation to check cathodic protection readings at this point the employee determined that the drilled pipeline was ventinggas gas control was informed of the situation and steps to shutin blowdown and repair the pipeline were implemented after a thorough inquiry by the gpg incident investigation team the senioro m tech involved in the incident was disciplined as a result of his failureto follow the procedures listed below and to reinforce the importance ofsafety interdependency gpg operating procedures gas testing; confined space entry;excavation; and work permits no gas testing was done by the gpg employee to identify escaping medium no gas testing was done before the gpg employee entered the excavationconsidered to be a permit entry confined space no gas testing was done before an ignition source was introduced into apossibly hazardous atmosphere in the excavation no confined space entry permit was issued when the employee reentered theexcavation to take cathodic protection readings the employee entered an excavation with inadequate means of egress no hot work permits were issued by the employee gpg operating procedure blowdown and purging the employee did not communicate in a timely manner the planned blowdown toresidents of the adjacent neighborhood gpg operating procedure event notification sequencea gas control did not notify the gpg environmental specialist of the release ofnatural gas gpg environmental procedure spills and releasesthe release of natural gas was not reported to the gpg division environmentalspecialist gpg operating procedure damage prevention the employee did not properly use maps when marking the pipeline the employee did not mark bends or other changes in the direction of thepipeline please note the practice of drilling into a pipeline to determine if it isabandoned is unacceptable and shall not be utilized preexisting abandoned pipe removal practice shall be as follows gpg employees shall contact local management when a preexisting abandonedpipeline must be removed to allow routing of other facilities localmanagement will contact the engineering department to evaluate the facilityand provide guidance to the team on how to proceed with pipelineidentification and the ensuing removal of the facility abandoned pipelines that will not be removed shall be treated as an activepipeline and marked in accordance with gpg operating procedure moving forward the pipeline safety department will review and revise gpg operating procedureto ensure that team members use all available resources to clearlyidentify an existing pipeline as active or abandoned the gpg pipeline safety department is investigating why the gpg facility wasnot identified on the aprilonecall ticket near misses there was potential for the contractor s backhoe operator to rupture andignite an active pipeline there was potential for natural gas to ignite under traffic plates coveringthe excavation in the area of a public road prior tothe team diverting traffic from the area there was potential for a flash fire in the excavation site due to the hotwork occurring in the area of the natural gas leak
