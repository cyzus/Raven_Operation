 Since we couldn t get us all together on the phone Sally you re out of the office I wanted to close the loop on some of the discussions we ve all been having on Doorstep After talking with Rick Carson Shona and I see several alternativesOur Needs Database ManagementStaff to do the deal test and write the report No matter what we want to use Rick Carson s group to maintain the Doorstep database Our GoalsThe one open question we need to resolve is whether or not Rick Buy does in fact want Rick Carson s group to develop trading expertise with the goal of being able to do Doorstep visits alone without the involvement of Market Risk Management MRM or Sally s Ops group Rick Carson indicated that was his understanding from talking to Rick Buy If that is the case we should select alternative below despite the inefficiencies If we are simply trying to carry out the Doorstep initiative in the most efficient manner possible it seems Carson s involvement is not actually the way to get there Alternatives Include Rick Carson s group to staff the deal test while including them in planning interviews etcRC does not have low level people to do deal test only; his people are experienced managers directors who would only be interested in participating if they were learning the trading business; it is also a management problem for his staff to be under someone else s direction so he wants their more active involvement Pros inclusion in interviews might shorten turn around time for them documenting the findings in the reporttraining of a RC s groupis this in fact a goalCons no real need for a rd level of brainswe just need brawn involvement byor more people in interviews might be intimidating to target personnel may be inefficient etcplanning and oversight withgroups in charge is inefficient and could cause accountability questionDon t use Rick Carson s group except for database managementInstead consider one of the followingA Have the MRM and Ops people assigned to the Doorstep do the deal test and write the report; bring a staff level person from MRM or Ops to do the deal test ProsEfficient keeps expertise and training within our two groups who can benefit most directly as trading is our focus vs Carson s group no issue with managing staff etc ; IssueDo our two groups MRM and Ops have resources necessary to devoteB Outsource to AA ConsLittle leverage on timeliness of report not developing in house expertise expensive C See if there are other internal resources like the Business Risk Management Energy Assurance Services group Internal Audit or accountants from Causey s other groups etc Assuming Buy does not actually plan to transfer responsbility for Doorstep to Carson s group I think Shona and I are leaning toward Ait depends on what you two think about itI think our staff level people would welcome the opportunity to participate and see other officesthe question is can we afford time wise for them to do so But if we want to train Carson s group with the idea of them eventually becoming the primary RAC Doorstep interface we can do that instead Let us know what you think so we can finalize our staffing plans Regards Cassandra
