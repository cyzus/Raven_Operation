 louise given the number of declines is there any latitude in moving up the canadian headcount i believe we cut very deep on the st go round specifically there is a couple of analysts and one manager on the commercial side and on the noncommercial side we d like to have at least one if not two admins for answering the phones admins are roughly u s k annum and ours are extremely good we still might come in under our initial headcount given the decline probabilities but i would like to offer additional jobs asap as opposed to waiting for responses
