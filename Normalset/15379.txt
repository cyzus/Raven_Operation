 jim please find attached some slides that show the results of the henwood run giving dispatch for the dabhol plant within maharashtra i have also sent the presentation we made to you to wade he is to get back on when would be an appropriate time for him to go over the presentation with me vince stinson and i have placed ourselves on rebecca s calender for friday and we will make the complete pitch to her it would be great if you too could be present at the meeting if it is possible please do let me know on the attached slides please note thatthe slides all assume that there is apart power tariff mseb liability for the entire capacity payment is not considered the henwood model was with no power flowing out of maharashtra when variable o m costs fixed o m cost plus fuel costs increased beyondcents kwh equal to mseb s average realization load went unmet inthe slide shows the monthly dispatch from dabhol in equivalent mw terms and also the load shedding in maharashtra we crosschecked the henwood run load shedding data against actual hourly load shedding data fromthat we had from mseb my estimate is that for december and january the load shedding maybe more than what the henwood model shows but overall the run passes the laugh test the graph also shows the monthly bill based on cents kwh that mseb would have to pay for the dpc dispatch the next slide shows our estimate of mseb s payment capability range frommm month the henwood run shows an average bill forto bemm month; though in some months jan it goes as high asmm hence overall mseb can pay for the dispatches as shown in the henwood run provided they are not paying for the capacity payment for the wholemw plant in conclusion therefore mseb has the need for betweentomw on a seasonal basis this means that the power remaining to be sold to other states is the difference between that andmw however since the demand within maharashtra varies seasonally it may mean that we need to market seasonal products to other states not long term blocks these are our conclusions we may continue to work some more on the fuel and hedging side if you have any more questions for me please let me know else for now there will not be any new henwood runs regards sandeep
