andthe state would not now be advancing a proposal to spend billions of dollars to purchase the state s three investorowned utility s electric transmission systems this year the state has spent more thanbillion on power purchases and with the cpuc has arranged to be reimbursed for these expenses noted glynn in contrast since june pacific gas and electric company has spentbillion in excess of revenues to pay for power for its customers and exhausted its ability to continue borrowing but there has been no progress on a plan to reimburse it for those expenditures as provided by law statements by the governor and other public officials since last september gave us reason to believe that a solution could be reached outside the context of chapterthat would restore the utility s financial viability and enable it to meet its financial obligations equitably however these statements have not been followed up by constructive actions and a reorganization in chapteris now the most feasible means of resolution the utility will utilize existing resources to continue operating its business during bankruptcy including paying vendors and suppliers in full for goods and services received after the filing the utility will pay electric commodity suppliers as provided by law the utility intends to continue normal electric and gas transmission and distribution functions during the chapterprocess employees will continue to be paid health care plans and other benefits for employees and most retirees will continue the utility s qualified retirement plans for retirees and vested employees are fully funded and protected by federal law notice a media teleconference will be held today at a m pacific daylight time to discuss this announcement pacific gas and electric company chairman robert d glynn jr and pacific gas and electric company president and ceo gordon r smith will be available for questions the dialin number is and the password for access is media an investment community conference call to discuss pacific gas and electric company s chapterfiling has been scheduled for a m pacific daylight time today a realtime webcast of this conference call can be accessed at www pgecorp com kwp sf contactpg e corporation news department keywordcalifornia industry keywordutilities energy today s news on the netbusiness wire s full file on the internet with hyperlinks to your home page urlhttpwww businesswire com symbolsus;pcg aprgmt source bwbusiness wire categoriesmst r us ca mst i elc mst i ois
