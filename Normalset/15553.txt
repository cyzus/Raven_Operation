 dear sven clemens i put together some packets of print outs from various links that i am familiar with; the packets cover electricity and gas markets and modelling deregulation exchanges weather derivatives and valueatrisk risk management case studies this is by no means final and i hope to supplement with some more ideas over the next few days once you have considered the material i can finetune the type of material that is relevant for you and then we can look at starting to put something together after which we can pass on to mike roberts if you need some simple articles on pricing options or an explanation on how to calculate volatility then i am sure we can put that together for you regards anjam x
