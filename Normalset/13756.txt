williams iii bill nonprivileged pst group this is an email i sent to our generators regarding decing and buyback strategies please read so you know what s going and can take the lead on implementing these strategies we ll let you know when all the generators on board thanks standue to the relatively weak realtime market during morning hours we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec bidding or buyingback generation that you ve sold forward we want to stress that this is a relatively shortterm strategy as the weather turns cold during the lateautumn and winter months the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the realtime market lately he have been very weak realtime ranging betweenandwe have two strategies that we would like to suggest decremental supplemental bids we can submit dec bids to the iso at a price below your cost to generate basically we would be letting the iso know that we re willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mw s from the iso to cover the prescheduled quantity you are still paid the dayahead price for the dayahead quantity but instead of generating it you would be buying it from the iso for example if your cost to generate isand you sell dayahead foryou makemwh if the iso takes the decremental bid and the price isthen you makemwh advantagesa relatively large upside the price the iso charges could actually go negative as large as negative also you would actually be buying from the iso as opposed to selling to the iso and being subject to credit risk disadvantagesten minute dispatch when we submit decremental bids the iso has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit everyminutes in addition to the physical problems this might create the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to followbuyingback blocks in the bilateral marketthis strategy calls for our realtime traders to buy blocks of energy in the bilateral market for below your cost to generate this would call for you to reduce your generation and the energy we buyback in the realtime market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity once again you are still paid the dayahead price for the dayahead quantity but instead of generating it you would be buying it at the price paid to buyback the energy as in the previous example if your cost to generate isand you sell dayahead foryou makemwh if we can buyback the energy for a price ofthen you makemwh additionally if we do buyback the energy we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the iso to remain compliant with the ferc order then if the iso takes the incremental bid you can generate the power and sell for additional profit advantagesnominute dispatch unless a supplemental bid is accepted you would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced also the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage disadvantagenot as large of an upside as decremental bidding at this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy buyingback blocks of energy in the bilateral market once you and our realtime traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the iso we propose a profit split above your dayahead profit earned from either of these two strategies if you have any questions or comments please call myself or chris foster stan cocke the services desk
