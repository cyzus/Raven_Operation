 you warned me not to say disparaging remarks about our clients i am doing my best not toalthough it is sometimes hard not to do so however i don t understand how these guys fire one of their two quants and then have the nerve to send the attached emailoriginal message fromsalmon scott sentfriday may am tomack iris cckaminski vince j; dhar amitava subjectreport to professor duffie hi iris i wasn t sure if you had already sent your report to professor duffie yet or not but i ve been thinking about ways that his group or the research team could really add value in an area where we re admittedly weakmodel testing if you haven t sent the report to him yet perhaps we can request his opinions on best practices for testing models with limited quality out of sample test sets obviously i d like to discuss this in detail with you as well especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now but i ll do that via phone i m hoping there are some statistical techniques we re currently ignoring that we can employ to maximize the testing we do and get a better handle on judging our accuracy if you ve got some time tuesday after our meeting where mike catches us up on the d b issues i d love to get your views as the model testbed is now in place and we re starting a model recalbration phase i m least comfortable about our plans for stress testing the models once we ve recalibrated them looking forward to talking to you tuesday regards scott
