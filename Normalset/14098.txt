williams iii bill nonprivileged pst everyone this is hot news showing that the caiso cdwr relationship is even more cozy than we thought i am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the public s and ferc s attentionaccording to two sources the caiso is helping to bail gov davis out of his highpriced cdwr longterm power contracts by purchasing cdwr s excess energy as an out of market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the caiso s supplemental energy auction as required by the caiso tariff the costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to scheduling coordinators who are largely unaware of the caiso s surreptitious transactionsthis sweetheart deal violates the caiso tariff which requires the caiso to buy energy from its supplemental energy realtime auction first caiso tariff dispatch protocol sectiond only after the caiso has used up the supplemental energy bids can the caiso buy out of market oom energy if the caiso were following the tariff cdwr s excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and cdwr would be paid the clearing price for supplemental energywhich is often as low as therefore under the tariff the caiso could have paid cdwr the same price paid to other scs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to cdwrby ignoring supplemental energy bids in favor of cdwr power the caiso is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the supplemental energy market low caiso demand for supplemental energy drives down prices the clearing price for supplemental energy has often been as low as therefore the caiso gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free if cdwr was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for itwhile there is no evidence that gov davis has directed the caiso to buy from cdwr first this behavior clearly benefits davis absent the caiso s purchases of cdwr s excess energy cdwr would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers the media has been been making hay out of davis s strategy of buying high and selling low therefore davis and cdwr benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the caisothe costs of this expensive cdwr power are being passed through to unwitting scheduling coordinators who frequently seeing minute ex post prices of expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to these scs are in for a big surprise according to one source at sierra pacific the caiso charged him as much asmwh for imbalance energy where is the price mitigation here who benefits under this scamdavis and cdwr who loses under this scaminstate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the caiso; scheduling coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energysourcesour client representative from the caiso has confirmed this practice and the friday burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it alsohere is the quote from the friday burritothere is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts the iso is utilizing the dwr contracts as out of market oom calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post beep market as one of our faithful observers told me the iso will be billing some drw cers longterm contracts to scs as oom energy this has been confirmed by the iso this means there is no realtime price transparency we may see an hourly expost price of saybut this will bear no resemblance to the eventual realtime settlement price there is no way to estimate what the oom charge was as the iso doesn t post that information the implication is that parties buying realtime energy will waitdays before theyhave any idea of the price this sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the ferc s goals of creating open transparent marketshere is the email from our caiso representativeoriginal message fromalmeida keoni [mailto kalmeida caiso com] sentthursday august pm toemmert caroline;
