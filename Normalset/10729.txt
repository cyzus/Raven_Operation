gas market as three factorsincreasing power generation demand lower storage inventories and us wellhead supply still struggling to reboundcall into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter as strong as gas market fundamentals are gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years in this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summerwith pressure increasing into july as temperatures riseand gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage enduse demand the per million british thermal units mmbtu increase in gas prices since the beginning of may has already driven responses among end users first gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the east coast and gas will likely lose approximatelymillion cubic feet mmcf per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last summer second several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut down equally telling however is that heat in any one region of the countrymost recently the westis all that is required to sustain gas prices above at the henry hub despite relatively moderate temperatures elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from current levels as higher temperatures arrive for these reasons cera expects prices to average at the henry hub during july see tableand even greater volatility is possible the intense competition and need to price out enduse demand mean that the market is vulnerable to spikes above per mmbtu amid heat waves this summer gas storageinjections increase but little relief yet the gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early june as storage injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages with the american gas association aga reportingbillion cubic feet bcf of injections during each of the weeks ending juneandhowever these injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close tobcf on a yearoveryear basis and conditions may not again be as favorable as they have been recently for injections for many weeks or even months to come as temperatures rise through the end of the month injections are likely to slow so that for june cera expects an average injection rate of approximatelybcf per day the deficit that stood at an estimatedbcf as of the end of may see tableon an inventory level of approximately bcf is expected to rise slightly during june tobcf despite a healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the month with us wellhead supply still running an estimated to bcf per day below yearearlier levels and with added imports from canada just offsetting this decline even the moderate demand growth expected for july relative to last july will make reducing the deficit a difficult task each month in which thisbcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this october injections like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into july for this pattern to reverse in a significant way an unlikely event that would occur only under very mild weather conditions regional markets with the exception of the rocky mountains western differentials have been supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power generation within the region this strong demand is pulling supplies from the permian and san juan basins to the west coast and has pushed up capacity utilization on the southwest pipelines into california prices at the california border have been particularly strong averaging over a premium to the henry hub so far this month continued strong western demand looks likely to support prices within the region through july as power loads remain strong and hydroelectric output declines in addition the early heat waves have begun to erode the california storage surplus although inventories in the region as a whole remain strong see tablecera s outlook by region followsrockies continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have pushed up exports out of the rocky mountains region high utilization rates on export pipelines will keep rocky mountain differentials wide during the rest of the summer cera expects an average july differential to the henry hub of per mmbtu san juan the pull on supplies from california has narrowed the differential between the san juan basin and the henry hub and this west coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer cera expects a differential between the san juan basin and the henry hub of per mmbtu during july permian and midcontinent as texas power loads increase the competition from the west coast and texas markets for permian supplies should intensify permian differentials which have been averaging around per mmbtu to the henry hub should narrow cera expects a per mmbtu differential for july midcontinent supplies should price just below permian supplies at an per mmbtu differential to the henry hub chicago chicago differentials continue to trade around per mmbtu to the henry hub and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region could put some upward pressure on those differentials ample seasonal pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure cera expects a july differential of per mmbtu northeast new york citygate differentials have a higher floor this summer namely higher fuel costs from the gulf coast as a result of gas the result has been differentials above from transco stationbut closer to from the henry hub as power generation load reaches its peak however differentials can rise even in summer shortlived power load peaks may lift weekly new york differentials into thes but for the month of july cera expects the new york differential to average canadian marketsdemand still down canadian demand continues to be down on a yearoveryear basis volumes on transcanada pipeline aremmcf below levels at this time last year and alberta demand ismmcf below; both of these reductions are primarily storage related weak storage injections driven in large part by the lack of an adequate summerwinter price spread continue to place inventories further behindlevels although inventories are still well above the fiveyear average unless injections increase it is more likely that endofseason inventories will be comparable to the fiveyear averagebcf rather than tolevelsbcf export volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year thus far in june flows on northern border pipeline are similar towhile pg e gtnw is currently operatingmmcf higher demand on the west coast is expected to continue this trend for the summer alberta supply build for june is likely to be flat withlevels an outage pattern similar to last year s has emerged tce nova has had maintenance projects ongoing in june but the supply reduction is primarily the result of plant turnarounds thus far in june reductions in supply because of maintenance have been as high asmmcf but should averagemmcf for the month even though june is expected to be flat yearoveryear the fact that this maintenance reduction is less thanmaintenance reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the year largely in the fourth quarter as a result of the increased level of drilling the annual average supply is expected to be aroundmmcf per day higher than inas the result of the return to growth in alberta and modest growth in british columbia again
