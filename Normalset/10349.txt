 just wanted to know i am working on your behalf i ll let you know what shelley says i really feel a need to keep the eol guys honest so a fullfledged agreement would probably not be overkill but in reality a term sheet is probably almost as goodforwarded by susan scott et s enron onpmsusan scottpm toshelley corman cctony pryor et s enron enron frazier king fgt enron enron subjectagreement with eol shelley i understand that there is a concern about tw having a written agreement with eol without the other two pipelines having an agreement from my perspective tw needs an agreement because tw is uniquely situated here s whymy understanding is that tw is the only pipeline that has been asked to pay a feethe developers michelle lokay and i have been talking to seem very uncertain about exactly what the fee coversis a lot of money to transwesterntranswestern has a recent history of not getting what it thought it had bargained for from affiliated companies and would appreciate our trying to protect them i am not trying to create extra work for anyone i am just a little confused about why a contract for tw would necessitate a contract for the othercompanies if you could help me understand i would appreciate it if the consensus is that we feel strongly that tw should not have a written agreement then i would at least insist on a detailed letter of intent or term sheet this would force both sides to think ahead about what is expected and as a practical matter it s highly unlikely that we re going to take legal action for breach of contract against an affiliate thanks
