 jeff we shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from sandeep with the numbers you have requested what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on the power situation in india published by the financial times the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting millions of people one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due to power shortages it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost of power produced by the dhabol plant expensive as it may be the power cut affectedmillion people the second article is enron specific vince asiapacificpower failure hits north india financial times; jan by angus donald tens of millions of people were left without electricity in northern india yesterday after a power grid breakdown electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and most parts of the capital new delhi withtoper cent of supply expected to be restored by the end of the day according to power grid officials the associated chambers of commerce and industry assocham a leading business organisation expressed deep concern and called for a mechanism to prevent future disruption that could cripple the economy the power failure across eight indian states including new delhi disrupted train services water supplies and the telephone network and forced hospitals to switch to emergency generators the fault occurred on the northern grid which provides electricity for m people and affected the states of delhi haryana punjab uttar pradesh himachal pradesh madhya pradesh rajasthan and jammu and kashmir a breakdown at a substation in kanpur in uttar pradesh india s most populous state caused an overload of power on other lines which then failed as well trains stopped running for most of the day and signals systems were damaged new delhi international airport was also slightly affected before its own power supply could be engaged we will probe into the reasons for the failure it is most likely to be a technical failure but we will investigate why it happened suresh prabhu the power minister was quoted as saying by press trust of india india suffers regularly from power problems because of lack of funding to upgrade infrastructure theft of supplies is also a big problem thirty per cent of the country s electricity is stolen according to analysts in new delhi as much asper cent is stolen two years ago a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh and delhi for hours assocham issued a statement saying that increasing industrial demand would exacerbate the problems already faced by india s inefficient power sector the slow progress particularly in strengthening the transmission and distribution system and ever increasing theft will contribute to worsening the power supply situation further copyrightthe financial times limited copyright the financial times limitedft and financial times are trademarks of the financial times

financial times; jan by khozem merchant enron the us energy producer and a constant target of criticism in india is hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a profiteering multinational its myth and reality offensive in local newspapers follows the west indian state of maharashtra s decision to review the tariff it pays the texasbased company whose dollarsbn electricity generating plant at dabhol is india s biggest single foreign investment maharashtra s tariff has more than doubled sinceand is three times greater than that charged by other independent power producers ipps the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha fuel the state also pays a fixed capacity charge of rsm dollars m a month reflecting the huge project cost and controversially irrespective of consumption a showdown looks inevitable reminiscent of a clash six years ago that damaged india s appeal to foreign investors a former official of the world bank which has criticised the deal says enron is emerging as the east india company of the st centurya reference to the british trader that colonised key areas of the indian economy in the th century the standoff is the latest blot on india s power sector the uk s powergen and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently frustrated by long approval procedures inadequate payments mechanisms or because of higher returns elsewhere india has lost time and opportunity and has driven returns down by six percentage points says gerry grovewhite former india general manager of powergen which has sold its mw plant in gujarat to china light power of hong kong india s national plan for the five years tosays generating capacity must rise bymw to aboutmw but sinceipps have added onlymw andmw remains under construction this is insufficient to support official projections oftoper cent economic growth enron was a bellwether of india s liberalisation winning fasttrack project approval in the early s phasea mw plant fuelled by expensive naphtha came on stream in mayand phasea dollarsbn plant ofmw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied natural gas lng will be completed this year only two of seven other fasttrack proposals have achieved financial closure from the outset enron encountered attacks culminating in maharashtra s then nationalist government cancelling the project before renegotiating terms no less onerous vilasrao deshmukh chief minister of the successor government says the power purchase agreement is unaffordable enron whose attackers also include cultural chauvinists wants to maintain good political relations in a hostile but lucrative environment enron views india as a testing ground for its evolution from a traditional manager of power plants to a broadbased trader of commodities such as energy gas and bandwidth to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy between power surplus and deficit states once legislation is passed this year it is building an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural gas and it is laying akm fibreoptic network to trade bandwidth space in a country desperately short of this new economy commodity in any event enron believes it has a watertight contract it is supported by many that believe any subversion of the contract would confirm investor perception of maharashtra india s financial and industrial hub as an unreliable destination for investment mr deshmukhwho has avoided the language of his predecessor which threatened to dump dabhol into the arabian seais under pressure from radical members of his wobbly coalition but his options are limited scrapping the project would be ruinous for an economically troubled state that would have to compensate shareholders maharashtra state electricity board the local utility and enron s main client is obliged to dispatch or offtakeper cent of dabhol s output yet mseb has never honoured these guarantees its offtake has averagedper cent since the plant opened and in effect mseb has been paying a lot more while consuming a lot less power one reason offtake is low is because the state s tough new regulator has told mseb to buy from cheaper sources enron says the tariff would be rskwh if mseb s offtake averagedper cent but with offtake a third lower the average tariff is rsper unit and often higher in october the tariff was rsper unit when offtake was aboutper cent enron says tariffs should come down when phaserun on cheaper lng starts these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only half of aper cent equity option in phaseenron has acquired the balance and mandated bankers to find a buyer enron s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps which have failed to deliver the flood of investments potential ipps feared they would never be paid by state generating boards that have become a byword for corrupt management of power reform of state electricity boards whose uneconomic pricing means industrial users subsidise poor farmers as well as transmission and distribution t d services to check huge theft and technical losses is overdue given the limited resources money would be better spent on t d rather than on new plant says oliver blackaby managing director of n m rothschild in india which is advising karnataka on the privatisation of its distribution network for the moment attention is fixed on enron s ability to satisfy the competing interests of investors and clients as sanjay bhatnagar chief executive officer of enron india said in a recent trade magazine one
