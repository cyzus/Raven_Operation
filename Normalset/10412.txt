below thesurface during the relative calm of late september and early october reemerged in force lastweek from midseptember through early october it appeared that a lucky combinationof mild weather storage injections abovebillion cubic feet bcf per day and a lack of storms in producing areas of the gulf of mexico had calmed the market somewhat henry hub prices settled near in the cash market less thanabove residual fuel oil last week however tragedy in the middle east andaslightly lowerthanexpected storage injection report were sufficient to drive november henry hub prices up by more than in two days to above mild weather may still soften prices from current levels but cera does notexpect the relative calm of late september and early october to return to the gasmarket turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices as nearlybcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return tothe gas market should prices decline relative to oil also weather must remain mildthrough october or else us working storage inventories may not reach eventrillion cubic feet tcf by the end of the month the headroom for price is muchgreater as distillate oil the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise is itselfin short supply shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important incrementof demand resistance as gas prices rise and neither switching to distillate norshutting down production comes easily or cheaply time is running out before the heating season begins and the market remains justifiably on edgeupward volatility remains much more likely than anysignificant settling in price as a result cera expects natural gas prices to besustained in the mids averaging at the henry hub during november see tablemore lucka great deal morewould be required to restore a measure of calm tothe gas market gas storagethe final push october storage injections have varied historically from bcf toapproximately bcf per day in the united states and this year cera expects them to averagebcf per day a moderate level for the month see tablethe reporting ofinjections ofbcf during the week ending octoberprecipitated a increase infutures prices but this rate is actually above average for the first full week ofoctober with the beginning of consistent heating load late this month cera expects aslowing of injections resulting in an endofoctober inventory of bcfmore than bcf below the previous record low for the end of october cera expects that many storage holdershaving begun the winter with recordlow inventorieswill preserve inventories to the extent possible during november however normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound inheating load from last years level and would require added storage withdrawals which cera estimates will average bcf per day this year withdrawals at that pace or even substantially slower as occurred duringandwill keepinventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of march low storage inventorieswill remain a major source of price support requiring that demand continue to bepriced out of the gas market and keeping gas prices above those of residual fueloil regional marketswinter rules the transition to winter pricing relationships is under way and the start ofwinter heating demand in the west has narrowed differentials between the supplyrich rocky mountains and the henry hub local demand for rockies supply has also eased pressure on san juan basin prices and cera expects differentialsbetween both regions and the henry hub to continue to narrow through november in the northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter with the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather the onsetof flows on alliance will limit increases in the chicago differential during novembersee tableceras outlook by region followsrockies earlyseason cold has narrowed rockies to henry hub differentials so far this month ample supplies within the rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of october and early november depending on heating load but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the per mmbtu summer level cera expects a per mmbtu differential to the henry hub during november san juan the increase in local heating demand in the rockies will continue to ease pressure on san juan prices by limiting flows south out of the rockies san juan differentials should follow the same relationships as rockies prices with general narrowing but continued volatility through november cera expects an average san juan differential of per mmbtu for november permian and midcontinent tight relationships between the permian basin and midcontinent and the henry hub should continue through november with some slight widening in the midcontinent basis differential expected when alliance flows commence cera expects differentials of per mmbtu and per mmbtu respectively chicago the beginning of service via the alliance pipeline during november is the focus of most attention in the chicago citygate market however the demand rebound that would result from normal november weather this year would offset most of the added supplies as a result chicago differentials will average in the per mmbtu range even when alliance flows commence although delay of the vector pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the midwest cera expects average november chicago differentials of per mmbtu northeast markets normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in new york citygate prices from yearearlier levels but there is little added delivery capacity into that market cera expects new york to price above the henry hub during november well above the current low o mids canadian marketssupply growth still uncertain the supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on alliance areuncertain a line pack of betweenandbcf has been established and modest flows of million cubic feet mmcf per day have been initiated to test and commissionthe pipeline the startup is still slated for novemberbut the unknownquantities of gas that are flowing on a daytoday basis are making it difficult to assessprecisely the volume of supply being produced at this time it appears that october ison par withthe current expectation is for over well completions in

aboutmmcf per day less in october than the yearearlier levels storage injections in the east haveaccelerated; eastern inventories are expected to be above last years levels at the end ofoctober
