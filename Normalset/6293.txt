 louise i have developed the attached proposal that i would like to propose to aep the basis of the proposal is that aep would take on all costs risks liens etc associated with the coastline law suite low casemm expected casemmenron would foregomonths of interest due to aep s failure to get doj approvalmm benefits to enron potential savings in enron expense vs aep s ability to capitalize the costenron still retains the doj stick in that interest payments start onjune instead ofmayenron saves time and legal costs not having to defend against the claimenron does not have to wrestle with aep to get access to hpl staff who are involved in the suite even though aep is obligated to make resources available to help us with the claim aep will have no incentive to do so after the sale let me know if you have any objections or questions brian
