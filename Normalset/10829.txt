demand levels up by nearlypercent over the same period inthese higher demand levels provided the year s first example of the power price spikes that can be produced when the west s tight capacity intersects with normal summer load levels lowerthannormal hydroelectric levels strong gas prices and california s immature wholesale power market structure as power markets reacted in june with unprecedented price strength throughout the region regulators and the california independent system operator iso intervened to dampen markets from a maximum ofper megawatthour mwh toper mwh although some market participants have filed protests at the federal energy regulatory commission to raise or eliminate the caps utilities legislators and consumer advocates are moving to protect consumers or completely redesign what they perceive as a flawed market as western markets move through the critical julyaugust peak electricity demand period market participants and regulators alike are wondering if power supplies will be sufficient and if price levels will rival those in june cera expects that western supplies will be adequate under normal summer weather conditions barring abnormal unit and transmission line outages however normal august weather conditions will push demand levels significantly higher than in june creating an even tighter supplydemand balance straining the ability of the transmission system to supply key demand regions adequately a hot weather event could exhaust both instate and imported supplies for california the tight supply and demand situation will almost certainly prompt a strong price response similar to that in june this will fuel the unease of regulators in states that have restructured their markets and in those that are considering restructuring even as regulators continued support of restructured power markets begins to waver a weather event that forces regional blackouts would force regulators to intervene cera s outlook for august power markets is driven by high peak loads under normal weather conditions westwide august loads will be on average megawatts mw higher than last august the peak load in california is expected to push capacity margins topercent even after curtailing interruptible load lower hydroelectric output as the west enters its peak load period hydroelectric production is expected to decline systemwide by roughly average megawatts amw from july to august compared with the high sustained output of last august hydroelectric output this august although roughly average on a historical basis will be roughly amwpercent lower high levels of gasfired generation compared with augusthigher utilization rates along with gas prices that have climbed per million british thermal units mmbtu will increase the incremental cost of energy production by overper mwh although cera expects power prices in august to diverge from production costs owing to the expected supply tightness higher production costs will create a higher floor for energy prices in all periods of the day the extremely tight power supplydemand balance within the west and within california specifically has resulted in unprecedented high summer gas demand for power generation this high demand levelcombined with seasonal storage injection needs in californiahas pushed up utilization rates on pipelines into california and pushed topock differentials over per mmbtu to the henry hub strong demand should continue through august in the west and support premium pricing at topock the rocky mountains represent the opposite extreme to the high premium placed on topock deliveries in the rockies supply is building relative to export pipeline capacity and market access is becoming a challenge weak seasonal demand compounds the problem; the strong western demand for gas for power generation does not extend to the rockies generation within the region remains nearly all coalfired these regional pressures should remain a feature of western gas markets through september moderate summer weather and reassuring injection rates nationwide during recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices at the henry hub however summer is not yet over and absolute storage inventories are still at critical levels higher gas prices are likely to resurface regional power market drivers august demand under normal weather is expected to rise by an additionalpercent or nearly amw over average june levels see tablepeak demand levels should exceed those in june as well with a coincident peak over the whole western systems coordinating council wscc of mw expected under normal weather conditions ina percent increase over the weathermutedpeak california alone should experience peak loads that are approximately mw higher than peak levels in june available generation capacity in the west has been at normal levels for this time of year although coalfired plants are responding to a record production year with repeated but shortlived outages the steady decline in hydroelectric generation will remove amw from the west resource base when compared with july levels and about amw since june although reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of hydroelectric generation during portions of june given hydro operators economic interest in maximizing onpeak production at the expense of offpeak production the loss of capacity during the onpeak period will be lower than these levels august will be a critical month for the heavily importdependent state of california while the state will be drawing approximately amw of imports during august to meet demands during peak periods cera expects the level of imports to exceed mw during peak demand conditions the southwest s need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to export to california and lower yearoveryear hydroelectric production in the pacific northwest will limit exports from that region pacific northwest cera expects pacific northwest demand in august to climb by nearly amw when compared with june levels the water supply for the pacific northwest has declined topercent of normal levels for the lower columbia owing to warmerthannormal weather in june in addition normal seasonal decline in runoff levels will drop about amw from the resource base when compared with levels in june see tablegeneration plant operators have responded to both growing native demand and a robust export market by running coal and gasfired generation at high levels although less than mw of gasfired generation is currently available in the region it has been running at high utilization rates high energy demand in california for pacific northwest energy will keep differentials low between the regions as in june pacific northwest prices will respond in kind to the volatility cera expects to occur in california in august in addition if hot weather in the pacific northwest pressures regional energy reserves local prices will rise to keep energy in the region potentially causing prices in the pacific northwest to move higher than those to the south california california is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating capacity down for maintenance although hydroelectric output continues to decline statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughlypercent of normal nevertheless declining hydroelectric production is expected to remove aboutamw when compared with hydroelectric production levels in june normal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about amw over june levels which were high see tablecalifornia s peak load is expected to exceed mw compared with a peak load in june of approximately mw mw on the state s iso system alone according to its own estimate assuming normal plant outage rates this demand level will necessitate the import of about mw of energy to meet the statewide peak even after curtailing the approximately mw of interruptible load available for tight supply situations the state has a precariouspercent capacity margin during the system peak an extreme hot weather event could push state loads up by an additional mw outages are likely if additional imports are not available a capacity limit of mw will be in place during the summer for energy exports from the pacific northwest to northern california the import limit from the pacific northwest to southern california will be mw rockies and southwest august demand levels in the combined rockies southwest region will increase only slightly above levels in augustclimbing approximatelyamw as loads in the regionunlike the rest of the belowaverage wsccwere near normal last august even so august loads will increase demand by over amw when compared with levels in june of this year as with last year and this june supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand conditions under normal weather although growing loads in the rockies southwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring regions with energy during peak demand conditions high loads driven by hot weather will keep the region s prices high differentials between the region and california will be tight but california having tighter supplydemand balances will need to price at a premium to attract energy the highcapacity transmission ties between the rockies southwest and the california market which is aboutpercent the size of the rockies southwest market will ensure that prices in the rockies southwest stay close behind california prices whenever loads are high in california regional gas market drivers evidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the west and supply and demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures since the northern border expansion in latenarrow northsouth and eastwest differentials across pricing points defined the market this summer the continuing supply growth in the rocky mountains has widened differentials between the rockies and the rest of the west at topock increasing gas demand in california and high utilization rates have resulted in high premiums overall in north american gas markets strong storage injection rates in recent weeks have allowed some easing in pricesfrom an early july henry hub price of per mmbtu to under per mmbtu however despite these high injection rates the supplydemand balance and absolute level of storage inventories remain precarious summer is not over and higher nationwide power loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost prices the ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should support an average henry hub price of per mmbtu in august through the end of the summer differentials in the west should hold near current levels the pressure of growing rocky mountain supply will continue until heating loads start climbing in the fall in california high seasonal power loads should continue through august with hot weather and continued declines in hydroelectric generation demand strength is expected to continue across the west august demand for gas should climb from billion cubic feet bcf per day in june to bcf per day buoyed by an increase in gas demand for power generation see tablecalifornia high gas demand for power generation within california will continue through august cera expects an increase from the state s june demand levels of bcf per day to bcf per day during august the increase stems from declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads total demand is expected to exceed last year s demand level by bcf per day this will increase flows on pipelines into california reduce the state s storage surplus and sustain high prices cera expects pipeline utilization rates during august to averagepercent see tablecera expects an august topockhenry hub differential of per mmbtu see tablepacific northwest despite the extremely high prices at topock and high demand in california until recently gas at malin priced at a slight discount to henry hub prices after averaging per mmbtu below the henry hub during the third quarter last year the differential so far during the third quarter this year is per mmbtu below the hub this week malin is pricing at a per mmbtu premium relative to the henry hub the topockmalin differential has swelled to over per mmbtu signaling intracalifornia pipeline capacity constraints two factors pressured malin differentials during the early summer pressure on rocky mountain and aeco differentials prices in the two areas supplying the pacific northwest are under some pressure increasing supplies in the rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put downward pressure on rockies prices by limiting external market access at aeco although export capacity out of the province is available almost all of that excess capacity accesses eastern canada on transcanada pipeline pipelines into the united states are running near capacity because of transcanada s limited ability to discount interruptible transport the available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled low early summer regional demand gas demand in the pacific northwest is limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and very strong hydroelectric output even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in may and june even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in california increasing power loads are already evident the first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall and regional demand in the rockies and western canada begins climbing however gas demand for power generation in the pacific northwest has increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of july and into august as hydroelectric generation wanes this added demand million cubic feet mmcf per day above june demand levelswill provide some support for malin prices and limited support for rockies and aeco prices malinhenry hub differentials are expected to average per mmbtu above the henry hub price during august rocky mountains pressure on regional supplies within the rockies continues as exports out of the region reach new highs differentials to the henry hub have widened to over per mmbtu and although prices in the rest of the west will gain some support from high power loads regional demand in the rockies is expected to remain near low seasonal levels through august august demand is expected to average bcf per day in the region approximately equal to june s bcf per day total demand demand begins to build during september but until the heating season begins in october rocky mountain prices will lag well below prices in the rest of the west cera expects a rocky mountainhenry hub differential of per mmbtu during august although some narrowing in rocky mountain differentials looks likely as seasonal demand increases through the fall the rapid build in supply in the region will likely keep differentials wide duringcera expects a supply build this year of nearlymmcf per day followed by a build of overmmcf per day duringcurrently approximatelymmcf per day of excess pipeline export exists out of the region with the largest increment on transcolorado into the san juan basin next summer all capacity will likely run close to full until export pipelines expandthe first likely expansion is trailblazerdifferentials will remain wide forcera expects an average annual differential below the henry hub of per mmbtu southwest differentials in the san juan and permian basins have gained considerable strength relative to henry hub prices amid the recent hot weather in texas permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the henry hub price and in the san juan basin prices have narrowed from an early july differential of per mmbtu to a differential of less than per mmbtu cera expects demand in the southwest during august of bcf per day an increase from june s level of bcf per day but the larger texas market will determine the relative strength of differentials in those two basins cera expects a san juan differential of per mmbtu during august with a permian basin differential of per mmbtu differentials between the rocky mountains and the san juan basin have widened substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the rocky mountains flows on transcolorado increased from a monthly average of undermmcf per day to overmmcf per day during june supply in the two regions is following opposite paths; rockies supply is climbing rapidly and san juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this year cera expects a decline in supply ofmmcf per day duringrelative toand an additional decline ofmmcf per day duringbecause of these different outlooks wider rockiessan
