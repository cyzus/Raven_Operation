 notethere are a lot of good names and organizations in this article especially the economic development councils worth spending some time with themlorna wednesday february nevada goes for the gold by dave todd dtodd ftenergy commailto dtodd ftenergy comit s a reverse twist on america s economic history one might even call it a case of eastward ho for the first time in the nearly two centuries that california has been part of the united states entrepreneurs are talking about leaving not moving into the golden state because of potential opportunities for doing business to the east not much farther east only over the mountains into neighboring states but still in that direction as opposed to jurisdictions north or south of california and the biggest lights in the eyes of one particular industry are emanating from nevada jack stewart president of the california manufacturers and technology association recently warned that massive power price increases and future rate hikes could be the genesis for industry departures from the state the impact on large industrial users he warned could provide an impetus for a statewide economic downturn in california which accounts for aboutof the united states gdp california s mass exodus since the beginning of the year nevada s primary economic development agencies have been overwhelmed by california companies wanting to relocate some or all of their operations to the state the bad news for california is that the list includes many silicon valley enterprises or wannabes whose growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the dependability of future electric supply delivery somer hollingsworth president and ceo of the nevada development authority in las vegas said in late january he was urgently asked to meet with corporate officials of a major california company to brief them about relocating to nevada in meeting with the company he asked are there others like youand they said yes we can introduce you to company after company after company overwhelmingly it is hightech california companies that are most interested in moving because of their evergrowing requirements for reliability in their electric service beyond that we have five power companies that have already come down here and talked to uspower producers he said these companies including calpine corp are keen to take advantage of a variety of opportunities made easier by the fact that unlike california nevada has no state income tax and no general corporate or business inventory tax putting it at both a geographical proximity and tax advantage to california it also puts nevada ahead of other lowtax western states such as arizona colorado and utah reno silicon valley share symbiotic relationship hollingsworth s northern counterpart at reno s public private sectorbacked agency the economic development association of western nevada edawn tells a similar story chuck alvey who heads that body says interest in his city from silicon valley refugees is becoming intense a mere threehours drive and minute plane ride from the san francisco san jose area reno and lake tahoe already house hundreds of hightech industry executives who commute back and forth and who have up to now escaped the impact of power drains caused by their energyintensive industries server farms banks of computers that manage web sites and related business operations continue to grow in number a single server farm can require as much asmw of power to operate strict new federal energy efficiency standards to curb demand by other power hogs such as residential central air conditioners and heat pumps clothes washers water heaters and commercial heating and cooling equipment won t be implemented in time to affect the current power crisis the u s department of energy last month announced that the energy conservation measures could save consumers and businesses more thanbillion over the nextyears though the energy saved would eliminate the need for mw of new power generation the new standards wouldn t be phased in until betweenandstan thomas director of business planning and growth strategies for sierra pacific power co nevada s dominant energy company said his business has experienced great success at moving silicon valleybased firms divisions into nevada albeit in a limited way but we re seeing a lot more companies sayingwait a minute we can t operate here anymore with power being shut off and having payrolls to meet and not producing any product he added that getting a little more aggressive about enticing electricity supplyconstrained companies to relocate to nevada is no longer likely to be seen as a cherrypicking operation at another state s expense in fact nevada froze its electric deregulation planning last year pausing to reconsider its options as a direct result of california s policy confusion we have delayed until we have a plan together where capacity exceeds native instate demand said thomas sierra pacific s power delivery capabilities are being enhanced by its plan to build a new kv line in eastern nevada to import power from utah init also installed a major line into the pacific northwest both developments are significant because the company has switched its strategy to become more of a power transmission distribution company than a generator we re learning our lesson here said thomas setting aside the issue of burgeoning energy demand requirements across the west the need to recover stranded costs associated with deregulation is a preoccupation for power plantowners in general he said as for california i think the next couple of years are going to be some tight times no doubt about it and that s why what we re trying to do in nevada is secure longterm contracts as well as shortterm contracts to protect our customers while we re in the process of securing capacity to ensure that we have an adequate supply of electricity at reasonable rates other areas targeting california companies it s not just nevada s physical proximity to california that helps it attract relocating companies it s also the different opportunities offered by nevada s two main population centers reno and las vegas both cities attract different kinds of energydependent businesses from california in this regard we are two different markets said thomas in any case nevada isn t the only state that s getting calls and returning interest in kind half a continent away tennessee s state department of economic and community development recently targeted about california companies with financial enticements and advertisements that proclaim the lights are always on in the electric powerrich tennessee valley authority s service territory elsewhere across the nation from seattle to manhattan there are initiatives to build or refurbish buildings to make them capable of servicing highenergy demand internetrelated data centers nevada however has one giant advantage aside from being closer to california las vegas for example has one of the most extensive readily accessible black fiber systems of any major metropolitan area in the united states but of course it would as the nevada development authority s hollingsworth jokedmost everything we have here is stateoftheart and brand new because we blow everything up everyyears we just implode it and build something new the most recent casualty to fall to progress was the el rancho hotel on the las vegas strip deemed past its prime which bit the dust in october in a televised entertainment spectacle power to the people
