 Dear David Thanks for your message To make our request clearer for the past two weeks we have put out a preliminary DPR every morning atam our time seen by commercial heads Jeff Skilling Ken Lay RAC anyone with access to the DPR All groups worldwide are able to provide us preliminary figures byam our time forpositions maturity gap VAR and P L This is the information that we would like you to provide as well I understand that you have some hurdles to get over to be able to provide us these figures and while you keep working to get over these hurdles we would be happy if you provide us the information you are currently able to i e if you can only provide P L we d like to start with that if you can only provide us with one commodities information we would like to have that Please remember that the information we are requesting is preliminary information We would expect that there would be some changes between what you give us atam and the final information you give us byam Best regards Shona David A Wall ECTAM ToShona Wilson NA Enron Enron ccJames New LON ECT ECT Chris Abel HOU ECT ECT Sheila Foo LON ECT ECT Michael Kass EU Enron Enron SubjectDPR Summary Shona Just to summarise the main thrust of our discussion yesterdayPreliminary P L due PM Local pm Houston As I understand Sally is the sponsor of this project with the goal of presenting Skilling with a DPR by a m the following day I have asked all mgmrs to assess how we can achieve this We will discuss this in meeting early next week A major obstacle that we face is limited IT resource to reengineer and expedite our processes This will require buy in of senior mgmt and commercial business heads to reallocate resources away from current projects James to discuss Additionally there are certain dependencies on depts in Houston which are prerequisite for DPR completion in London Notably Continental Power has a dependency on Portcalc IT support in Houston Shift work andhour days are more difficult not impossible to implement in London as the labour market is very tight and such working conditions would make Enron very uncompetitive as a prospective employer Bear in mind that we compete directly with all the big investment houses for the best talent A decision to use shift s would have to be made at the highest level considering the possible implications on the corporate image This might suggest that additional IT resource is the only feasible way forward I could easily say that we can do the preliminary p l but I assume that we wish to retain the qualatitive features of our reporting Therefore I have tempered my comments to reflect what I believe are real issues that we in London will have to address We will get back to you with our proposals after we have discussed these issues early next week Same day DPR This is the long term goal and is such a large project that it would have to be sponsored at the highest level here in Europe James to discuss with Fernley Mike Regards Dave
