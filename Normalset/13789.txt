williams iii bill nonprivileged pst keoniwe had another unpleasant experience with hildago last night this is the third different individual at epmi who has had an interaction with him resulting in a hassle the other day i wrote it off to my fault but since it has happened withother people here and only with hildago i now believethe problem is him he has a natural antagonistic demeanor that makes people defensive and angry when he calls he accuses us of not meeting our obligations and demands information and says things like if you do not provide this information i will turn you in we understand our responsibility to provide outage information to the iso we are diligent in completing outage reports and submitting them to the outage coordination desk at the iso the iso is requiring an additional communication with the real time group to either confirm that the outage ended as planned orchange the outage timing if required although to my knowledge this requirement is not in the iso tariff and has not been communicated to scs in writing inany way and furthermore is a waste of time for everyone will make efforts to do this the iso should recognize however that in most cases our real time group is not aware of outages our generator sc clients nor shouldthey be as these units our off line and therefore out of play in real time hildago should work to communicate better and treat people with respect he clearly is not doing that with us thanks chris
