 hi amy jim irvine ebs head of network planning and i team lead ebs research will attend the meeting we will have our assistances christine blair kristy carnes respectively arrange the trip we will plan to come in the night before and return on march also either vince kaminski md and head of enron research or stinson gibner vp enron research may also attend they will let me know shortly if they plan to attend regards ravi p s our company name has been changed to enron broadband services kristy christine please make the appropriate travel arrangements the place time etc are listed amy sdsc edupm toravi thuraisingham enron communications enron communications ccsubjectcaida metrics wg meetingmarfwd hi ravi i wanted to follow up directly with you and see if you or anyone at enron had any interest in participating in the proposed caida metrics working group meetingplease let me know amy e blanchard caida emailamy caida org phonefaxb wg charters meeting onmari believe that we should instead run a single caida working group on network metrics rather than the two proposed earlier my draft of its charter is appended below it focuses on producing educational material about network measurement and on developing new metricsthese were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the caida members the wg cochairs are sue moon sprintlabs and brett watson mfn abovenet you are invited to attend the first wg meeting the agenda is as follows agenda for caida wg meeting onthursdaymaram pm abovenet downtown sjc see below for detailsreview wg charteris it reasonable as set out in the draft what should be removed or added work through revised charter in detailidentify the work required for each partdetermine who s willing to work on itattempt to determine delivery timesdiscussion of new metricsfirst attempt at making a list of metrics to be consideredanything else locationabovenet is located in the knightridder building attached to the fairmont hotel complex the address isw

wg charters a what types of network and transportlayer metrics are being used by isps in engineering and operating their networksby customers for verifying service guaranteesb what new services are being or are likely to be offered e g diffservis there a need for higherlayer metrics to better monitor and manage these servicesc will these new differentiated transport and applicationlayer services need new metricsd how can the service metrics be measured in a multiisp environmente how can customers verify these measurementsf what requirements would service measurement introduce for equipment vendorsg how relevant are specific techniques e g which flow and points of measurement to specific users isp customer etc requirementsh how do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived by usershow do they correlate with performance appendix bbackground on the ietf working groups rtfm wgrealtime traffic flow measurement rtfm is concerned with passive measurements of twoway traffic flows specified in terms of their endpoint attributes its primary goal was to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the following needsa wider range of measurable quantities e g those relating to ipv and to class of service b simpler ways to specify flows of interest c better ways to control access to measured flow data d strong focus on data reduction capabilities e efficient hardware implementation ippm wgip performance measurement the ippm wg charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can be applied to the quality performance and reliability of internet data delivery services these metrics will be designed such that they can be performed by network operators end users or independent testing groups it is important that the metrics not represent a value judgement i e define good and bad but rather provide unbiased quantitative measures of performance rfcs framework for ip performance metrics rfcmetricsconnectivity

application performance measurement this is clearly a hard problem e g does this just mean responsetime measurement can it be done by passive means how should the measurements be presented etc in
