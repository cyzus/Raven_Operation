 The cause of this was the timing of when SAP went down SAP had a major system crash the day Willie finaled his supply verification in Unify Before Willie went into SAP to net the payable same day SAP crashed By the time SAP came up the treasury run had already picked up the payable and wired the cash When we issued the recall the money was already out the door As a result we put a policy in place that all supply verifications for netout customers must be overridden as soon as they are finaled in Unify This causes them to be blocked in SAP and not picked up by treasury until the payment block is removed This policy went into effect at the beginning of September However this still relies on human intervention to ensure the procedure works To ensure we don t accidentally release cash I have asked Unify IT to change the interface to send all purchases for ENA to SAP blocked which will require the coordinator to release funds This is an added step but is worth it considering the stakes This change will go into effect on Monday If you have any questions please let me know Bryce Enron North America Corp FromSally BeckPM ToBryce Baxter HOU ECT ECT Leslie Reeves HOU ECT ECT ccSubjectRePerry Gas SAP Override issue I have read this series of e mails but I am not sure that I fully understand the issue Did Willie not do his jobAre there problems with how SAP worksAre both of these an issuePlease let me know if we have a far reaching problem with SAP and netting Thanks SallyForwarded by Sally Beck HOU ECT onPMFromWilliam S BradfordPM ToSally Beck HOU ECT ECT ccDebbie R Brackett HOU ECT ECT SubjectRePerry Gas SAP Override issue Sally Are you aware of the problems with SAPThis error caused an incremental credit loss to Perry Gas Companies that could have been prevented Let me know if you have any questions BillForwarded by William S Bradford HOU ECT onPMFromRussell DiamondPM ToWilliam S Bradford HOU ECT ECT Debbie R Brackett HOU ECT ECT ccSubjectRePerry Gas SAP Override issue FYIForwarded by Russell Diamond HOU ECT onPMFromBryce BaxterPM ToRussell Diamond HOU ECT ECT ccSubjectRePerry Gas SAP Override issue Russellas I remember Willie finaled the Supply Verification and it was interfaced to SAP This is fine and then Willie was going to net the A P and A R SAP went down after the statement was interfaced but before Willie was able to block or net the payment When SAP came back up the next day the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire If you have any further questions about this call me Thanks FromRussell DiamondPM ToWillie Stewart HOU ECT ECT ccAudrey Cook HOU ECT ECT Bryce Baxter HOU ECT ECT SubjectPerry Gas SAP Override issue Willie Per our earlier conversation can you or Audrey or Bryce please give further explain to me as to why the funds were wired to Perry Gas for purchases from the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty s that net on SAP although because of timing the override did not take place Thank you Russell
