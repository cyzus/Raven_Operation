williams iii bill nonprivileged pst million profit from the west is not much to show for all of the sleeving sempra did for the iso sempra s trading unit generates a windfall by craig d rose staff writer july sempra energy the parent company of sdg e reported apercent surge in profit tomillion last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of electricity under a longterm contract to california on the other hand sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit a middleman that earnedmillion during the quarter buying and selling energy produced by others the results underscore the transformation of relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity and the turmoil in energy markets the surprising announcementthat a company lost money selling power during california s runup in electricity priceswas explained by sempra as an intentional consequence of the longterm contract it signed with the state to provide power stephen baum chairman and chief executive officer of sempra said the company agreed to provide a steep discount to california during the summer months but would recoup the losses later in the year deal california sought longterm electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and nearterm power markets where prices reached record levels critics say gov gray davis rushed into longterm deals because of concerns about getting through next year s election they also say the contracts will saddle customers with higher costs for years the governor has acknowledged that longterm contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for electricity in later years but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for lowering prices that were devastating the state economy michael shames executive director of the utility consumers action network in san diego said the steep discount sempra provided to the state on power this summer raised questions about the governor s proposal to help san diego gas electric co clear a debt ofmillion sdg e says it is owed that money for power purchases on behalf of its customers in a media conference last month davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible balloon payment for consumers who he said might have faced the socalled balancing account debt as early as next year shames says the proposal which took the form of a memorandum of understanding or mou is costly for consumers and a bonanza for sempra he said the relatively cheap power provided by sempra this summer makes the mou sound like more of a hidden payback to sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers shames said he will release an analysis of the state s sempra plan next week the state public utilities commission is expected to rule on the plan in august a sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the tentative agreement to clear themillion debt doug kline the sempra spokesman said the power contract with the state was signed in early may and the agreement on the balancing account was reached in midjune sempra energy

comparable period last year california s independent system operator which manages most of the state power grid and other investigators have said trading and bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during the california power crisis though sempra earned money on trading its wholesale power generating business lostmillion during the quarter baum said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of the loss for sempra energy resources but added that a plant outage also contributed sempra energy resources which coowns a generating plant near las vegas with reliant energy earnedmillion during the second quarter last year baum added that sempra s longterm contract with the stateunder which it will provide up to megawattshas allowed its
