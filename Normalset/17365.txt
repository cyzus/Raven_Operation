 bill we spent about an hour with rick explaining the rationale behind differentsolutions and i think he has a better understanding of the models at this point i think he was asked by jeremy to look into it vince fromwilliam s bradford enron enronxgate onpm torick buy enron enronxgate vince j kaminski hou ect ect ccmark ruane enron enronxgatesubjectfwcredit risk model commentsat this point rick vince should this not be a credit research initiative while the business unitfocuses on originating good economic transactionsnot to be complaining but shouldn t ees be focusing on infrastructure issues rather than wasteresources on a project we are already moving forward onyou can t run aportfolio model unless you have deals in a risk system how complex do wewant these models to bebehavioral implications on credit defaulttheystill don t seem to understand regards bill markplease attend you may want to include martin to help ees understandthe complexity of their deals original message fromkrishnarao pinnamaneni sentwednesday april am tokaminski vince;

the number of trials numerical roundoff and random numbergenerator randomness statistical properties the first two are not a problemin this application but the last one could be has anyone examined the effectof using different random number generators on enrons aggregate credit risk there is one last point here for most of the above points the improved analysis could make the credit risk be higher rick
