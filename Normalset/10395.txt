 sorry michelle i was hoping to get you at least some type of bid but tenaska is very closely reviewing where our investment dollars are going right now with everyone s credit being looked as so closely and with various storage and other projects that are currently requiring investment dollars with that review it was decided by our management since we are not as well established in california as other areas it would be best not to send in anybid at this time if you have other opportunities please let me know i want to continue to build our presence on tw as the situations allow thanks for your helpmichelle lokay enron compm karen looking forward to your bid proposals see attached fileeasttoeast doc
