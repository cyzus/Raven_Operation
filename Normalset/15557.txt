 dale thanks for the update i fully concur with all the rankings it seems things are going well with the research group in london and this is to a very large extent your contribution i think that anjam has improved a lot i don t think however that he can run the group in the future steve emerged as a natural leader and has overwhelming support in the organization vince dale surbeyam tovince j kaminski hou ect ect ccsubjectlondon research prc vince we had the prc preranking for rac and research in london yesterday here s how everyone came outstevensuperiorno controversy here steve received consistently strong feedback ranked as either superior or excellent in all categories the only rough spot was teamwork arising from the friction between anjam and himself anjamexcellentanjam received rankings of superiors or excellents in all categories several reviewers commented that anjam s performance in the areas of producing results in a timely manner and communication have improved i felt the overall ranking of excellent was justified based on this feedback even though in terms of leadership i don t rate him high enough to run the group here stinsen provided the most insightful comment on anjam s performancetechnically superior but lets his quest for a leadership position detract from his overall performance on a related topic anjam has been taking random days off typically on short notice so i suspect he s interviewing for a new job given his inability to work with steven especially in the future when stephen heads the group this may be the best longterm solution any thoughtsbensuperioranother noncontroversial ranking ben received consistently high marks from all the groups he supports especially in the area of nontechnical skills i nominated ben for promotion to senior specialist even though he was promoted at year end he s taken on a lot of responsibility training kirstee and helping manage the other quant resources in brian s group also since kirstee was hired in at the same level as ben a midyear promotion is appropriate since he s effectively her supervisor kirsteestrongonly limited feedback in themonths she s been here high marks for technical quantitative strong in the soft skills i think the strong rating is the right message for early in the gamegives her a target for improvement for the rest of the yeardale
