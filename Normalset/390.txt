 I completely agree with you Nevertheless I am sorry if I did not make myself clear when we talked about this last TuesdayI am not advocating penalizing business units because of their week ROVARs or Sharpes I would certainly not set traders bonuses based on these numbers nor do I think anyone at Enron would consider doing that Enron focuses on long term profit and risk However the long term is made up of many short terms and catastrophes can occur if a company s management does not pay close attention to the latter Indeed Enron management is very interested in short term profitability they want to be notified of very largeandday losses and short term risk we report daily VaR limit violations In this spirit I am simply offeringandweek ROVARs and Sharpes as something interesting and useful that we can now produce from the DPR database and I will let upper management use or ignore them as they see fit Regards Eugenio Naveen Andrews ENRONAM ToEugenio Perez HOU ECT ECT ccTed Murphy HOU ECT ECT SubjectRisk Metrics Eugenio In regard to your recent email concerning RoVar Sharpe and other risk metrics and our meeting on Tuesday it is imperative to understand thatWhile P L is a number one can aggregate on a daily basis VaR numbers on week or week basis and consequently RoVaR numbers are not meaningful operationally ie trading activity and senior management decisionmaking and statistically RoVaR and Sharpe were designed to measure business unit performance over extended time periods preferably a year Specifically you cannot penalize or make reasonable business decisions about a unit because of their week RoVar or SharpeSignificant trading activity at ENE is composed of longterm strategic trades seasonal plays with durations of overmonths perhaps wherein desk heads and senior management have an intuitive feeling for their RoVaR OVERMONTHS A week or week interim number in this case is not useful Traders might purposefully want to make a certain week or week RoVaR LOW in their trading activity if they believe their month number can be HIGH In such a case a week number might send dangerous messages to senior managementConceptually P L and VaR in isolation are numbers which are sound and rigourously calculated The Ratio however one has to be careful about The numerator cumulative P L over a certain period can be aggregated by simple arithmetic summation no problems However the denominator average daily VaR over a certain period relies on the underlying assumption that each point in your time series is independent and correlationless To get a sufficient statistic for the denominator one would have to take a large sample in your seriesmonths or more for a DAILY AVERAGE VaR number to be meaningful statisticallyThe RAC group has instituted similar metrics which have been in usage for over two years The numbers are shown to the B O D with the express intent of comaring business unit performance on a month or yearly tenor Please contact Matthew Adams RAC or myself to make sure that we are on the same footing regarding the actual calculation of such metrics Also in the future just to be consistent and onthesamepage please contact me or Mr Adams if any riskrelated numbers are to be showcased in a public forumFinally as you can probably corroborate senior management might not be fully versed on the nuances of VaR let alone week VaR ratios Therefore one has to be wary of the misuse of ratios and risk metrics I liked your presentation of your database on Tuesday I think it is a nice step in aggregating and dissecting P L from disparate sources Best Regards Naveen
