 guys first of all louise i understand we have a babycongratulations details please at your earliest chance regarding the wharton ebusiness initiative see below for one of the many emails i ve received concerning enron s participationlink to the referenced web site for specific agenda; also i ve received several voice messages from leaders of the effort the information below discusses one of the forums coming upthat comprise an ongoing ebusiness initiative in which enron has invested with wharton the participants from wharton include senior level professors; while there may be some student involvement the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level other participants in webi are corporate representatives the idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial ebusinesses are seeking new research again this is intentionally designed as a high level professor participation on the wharton side and high level ebusiness corporate executives on the other side this is intentionally designed to create a highlevel ethinktank environment for senior level professors and corporate executives o k have i labored enough to describe what webi is all aboutas opposed to the several other efforts enron university affairs has to directly increase enron s favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting this is intentionally a research discussion effort clearly the enron brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings references course work etc a few weeks ago louise and i breifly chatted about enron s involvement in this effort clearly there is a huge interest by the wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have enron attend and participatethey quite respectfully call me and email me very frequently all of this is very interesting to me and i have shepherded our minimal involvementinfact yet the question remainsis there someone at enron directly involved in enron s ebusiness initiatives interested in jumping into this effort and participatingdo those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense or the time and expense of one of your senior at least director level people to participatewould it be viewed at least at this time simply as an enron brain drain i ve received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at enron the bottom line is i d like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at wharton committed to this effort i feel more than comfortable telling wharton that at this time enron is satisfied to participate in the webi effort largely at the financial level it has already investedwith the option to participate at other levels in the future at enron s discretion all comments solicited many thanks christieforwarded by christie patrick hou ect onpmhartleyrhartleyr wharton upenn eduon pm tochristie patrick enron comchristie patrick enron comccsubjecticg wharton forum meeting may junechristie lee goldring our new forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you to introduce himself and follow up on enron s representation at the next meeting i m emailing this information to you to alert you to the situation since i do not think you would want enron to go unrepresented at the next meeting to date no one from enron has registered for the forum sponsored online conversion workshop the forum meeting on or the members only meeting on please note that the from browsers to buyersonline conversion workshop on may th is purely optional in case some folks from enron are interested in attending since the forum is cosponsoring the workshopwebi affiliated registrants will not be charged theregistration fee as an added benefit for their sponsorship here are all the relevent links to the forum agenda and registration sites for your convenienceforum agendahttpwebi wharton upenn edu meetingnotes m n asp forum registration sitehttpecom wharton upenn edu conferencereg reg asp from browsers to buyersonline conversion workshophttparestydirect wharton upenn edu execed conversion index html please let me know if there s anything i can help you with best regards robin robin hartley associate director wharton electronic business initiative university of pennsylvania vance hallroom spruce street philadelphia patel fax hartleyr wharton upenn edu httpwebi wharton upenn edu
