 john louise robi thought i would fire off a quick note to inform you that duke produced a nonbinding bid for the entire sundance b ppa duke s bid is cthis compares to an earlier bid of cto cfor one unit on july duke s bid combined with the cost structure of the ppa would have duke buying the ppa for approximately c mw or us mw the marktomarket value of both the sundance units as of september th s curves was ctherefore a sale to duke at cmm would not provide any significant increase to earnings additionally it must be noted that the curves have some very conservative heat rate assumptions built into to the latter years based on a conversation with john last week he clearly indicated that selling the ppa for under us mw is not acceptable i would agree with john that enron would better be served by maintaining its current position than accept a bid reflecting a price less than us it must be noted that duke s bid expires atpm cdt septembertherefore if anyone feels strongly that we should move forward with duke we should address it immediately otherwise don miller and i continue to position enron for the division of the ppa and subsequent auction derek
