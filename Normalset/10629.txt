 drive to succeedenron prefers toyota to gm to prosper in the new energy economy enron coo jeffrey k skilling says oil and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead reshape themselves to resemble toyota when it captured the imagination and pocketbook of u s consumersyears ago in a somewhat backtothefuture treatise on how enron expects to continue its monumental success skilling told arthur andersen energy conference attendees to define themselves not by their industry but rather by their skills base toyota changed the u s auto industry by outsourcing its production offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster the energy industry has to do the same thing into the future he told the houston audience inthe energy industry was a very rigid industry he said pointing to a similar business model that had been used by general motors and ford motor co those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process keeping all of its pieces within the corporate structure then toyota turned things upside down when a customer wanted a different radio toyota relied on outside producers it didn t stop the production line to please the customer and it was able to do it faster enron has used the same model to shape its achievements packaging components for customers to save time and money other energy companies are now adopting that method in many ways skilling said enron views itself as the toyota of the energy industry we don t feel we have to provide all components but package them the way the customer wants them this is a pervasive trend we are seeing all over the industry enron which has had a shareholder return of inyears januaryto novembersaw the changes required by new technology and deregulation and redefined its core competencies which grew from its pipeline business skilling said to remain successful the houstonbased corporation plans to continue to morph it all hinges on one good idea enron had in the s that vertically integrated structures had dominated our industry and the structures were starting to break up in the energy industry the reason was deregulation fundamentally this is a better business structure for two reasonsyou can be supplied with cheaper cost components and it allows you to change much more quickly instead of bigger energy companies skilling said he expects to see many smaller companies maybe thousands tied together electronically and vertically the transformation and interaction costs are collapsing across the economy as an example of interaction costs skilling used bank tellers init cost a bank a transaction to bank on the internet today it costs a bank less than a penny this drop in interaction costs is a major reason enron finds the bandwidth market so attractive inthe length of time to provision bandwidth was six to eight months today it s two to three months and next year skilling predicts it will take one second we will have bandwidth on demand by next year he said and added that enron plans to be the leader in the field similarly longterm gas contracts intook two to three years to execute inthey took nine months three years ago they took two weeks to execute today using enrononline and other similar internet trading systems it takes less than one second all of the sudden the world has changed we have the same manufacture cost but interactive costs collapse i think that because of this we ll see the collapse and demise of integrated energy companies around the world skilling said to survive skilling advised companies to virtually reintegrate what they need if you have an old vertically integrated mind set it s tough give it up i know there are still power producers who are buying gas reserves i don t get it it makes no sense whatsoever you can get it online at the lowest cost if your business strategy is dependent on this it will be a very hard row to hoe each stage of production will become increasingly competitive in the nextyears predicted the enron president you re not just competing against three people in west texas but thousands around the world opportunities exist he said for those companies that go with the flow and find ways to compete create low cost dependable market interfaces provide packaged turnkey solutions for customers through complex structures differentiation and customization the only threat is from the old way of doing business he said but there is tremendous opportunity to do things for customer you ve never been able to do he suggested a new energy model based on brainpower networking offering real options to customers moving quickly and being entrepreneurial at enron this has been the whole premiseto be able to change by responding and reacting to the environment by getting components together and packaging them for the customer
