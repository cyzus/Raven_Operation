negotiations that floppedapparently the difference between billion and million between parties could not be settled below is a rough breakdown corporate offeringswilliams duke reliant dynegy mirant million combined powerex bc hydromillionpower marketers including enron millioncalifornia municipal utilitiesmillion loadserving entities outside camillion northwest utilities submitted their calculations of overcharges however judge curtis wagner has virtually ignored northwest claims ofmillion in overcharges stating there was little time to address the issues raised by the pacific northwest parties they did not have data on what they are owed nor an amount of refunds due them contrary to the judge s claim anumber of northwest utilities did submit claim amounts at the settlement conference although the problem is each utility has its own methodology forcalculating these amounts wagner was probably frustrated that there was no standard methodology for these calculations and appears to be leaning against giving nw utilities the same fasttrack status as california ferc had originally not even wanted to consider nw claims in this conference until a group of nw senators got together and applied some pressurethe result was there was not much time to get the overcharge data together below is another rough breakdown of the claimspacificcorp million snohomish pudmillion

concerned about bumping up against spending caps when it added the mandate for annual reauthorization bonneville has warned it could exhaust its borrowing authority by the end ofunless the amount was

increasedborrowing authority would be used to update transmission infrastructure retrofit columbia river hydropower projects to boost efficiency and continueconservation programs we can expect to see more action coming out of senmurray s office refundsrecent media reports have hinted to the possibility of northwest utilities including bpa seeking refunds for the overpriced power california is currently fighting this information seems supported by fears that earlier settlements reached between northwest utilities and california state may be challenged by bankruptcy proceedings if a bankruptcy court were toissue a ruling that significantly altered agreements between bpa and pg e potentially bankrupt socal ed it is possible that bpa could press a refund request in the range of m to m however while bpa s refund request may be an option to stabilize their finances they are also carefulabout voicing their opinion because of themillion in gross sales they made from california bpa administrationthe bush administration reportedly has no current plans to replace the bpa s administrator the entire northwest delegation democrats and republicans from the bpa region has asked that he be made the fulltime administrator however since many of the decisionmakers at doe are conservative republicans they re not comfortable with him because he is a democrat at this time doe people are unsure of how to handle this matter and appear to be in a state of limbo dsi aluminum smelterload reduction agreementsbpa is in the hot seat right now realizing that falling electricity prices is making it possible for smelters under load reduction agreements to begin shopping around for other sources few believe that these current market prices will be sustainable considering the fact that the west will see a significant supply increase within the next year consequently dsi s will be very concerned aboutsigning long term price contracts given the current downward pressure on prices which are still historically very high but dropping currently there are two northwest smelters seeking to restart plant operations alcoa is in preliminary talks with bc hydro to secure additional power to restart its intalco smelter and kaiser free from the money and the constraintsof a loadreduction agreement is also attempting to restart plants we will continuing monitoring of this situation and will update as the story develops bc hydro rate freezethe current rate freeze was imposed by the former ndp government and it endsseptemberit is up to the government to direct the bcuc to lift the rate freeze and before it can do that it has to schedule a rate hearing and decide to put the utility back under the bcuc s purview it has been a number of years since there was a rate hearing and people are not looking forward to it because it begs all sorts of questions about overall energy policy a rate hearing will be delayed until the new government has completed its administrative core review and decided on a broader energy policy including its goals for bc hydro lifting the rate freeze partly depends on how much regulators believe should be held in the rate stabilization accountthis money has been redirected elsewhere over the past few years leaving the utility unprepared for the sort of lowwater conditions that have surfaced this year bc hydro wants the freeze lifted and the new government will have an ideological bias against continuing the rate freeze given that it was put in place by the ndp and flouts free enterprise principles this suggests the rate freeze is on the way out but it may persist beyond the originalseptember deadline for the reasons outlined above how long it persists depends on how long it takes the new government to complete the core review
