 Fernley On January I had breakfast in London with a shaking Richard Sage who recounted the tail of Barry threatening his bonus and employment for doing exactly what Jeff Skilling told him to do in the previous November Subsequently Richard was moved from his position and Barry promoted If that is dealing with the situation this actually reflects on your credibility If you think that an open communication independent back office message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London by virtue of your promotion of Barry twice inmonths then you are sorely mistaken On February the Arthur Andersen team including Tom Bauer John Sorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily completing the Audit tasks from London I am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here You have dismissed my advice and you need to do what you need to do If the goal is to get me to change my view you have a big hole to dig out of I obviously can t change your point of view I still feel a responsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to surface It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere Need I go on Let us stop the email wars now They serve no productive purpose Ted

in the past and I have followedup on specific instances you have mentionedI believe they date back toand prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughoutand the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has changed since then We are not so Barrydependent We have a team of quality risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary recruiting ground for the RAC team David Port Oliver Gaylard Barry s role is much less handson now and he is not our candidate for the Global Products positionthis will continue to be Kevin Sweeney The role I suggest for Barry is the high level coordination of the operations teamhis energy enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan combined with his considerable institutional knowledge making a superior candidate difficult to find Frankly I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth but to address the relationship issue that clearly existsI do not belittle this issue and while I don t think that anyone can point to any prosecutable offences that Barry may have committed in recent history his management style doesn t help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and objective I will say that he has always been open and frank very frank with meindeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a different story to tell on Helsinki As an aside I have not been involved in or consulted on the World Tour although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks back I think it is great that Brent Price is involved but we would be happy to contribute staff to this too Regards Fernley ToFernley Dyson LON ECT ECT ccRick Buy Sally Beck HOU ECT ECT SubjectReTrading Support OperationsLondon Fernley As we discussed earlier this year I have serious concerns about Barry that I think are both wellfounded and reasonably well documented To be fair I will say that since Q of last year I have not seen any FURTHER prosecutable offenses and he has made some attempts at being more communicative However I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his transformation particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in charge of the office Probably more to the point it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team that is not so Barrydependent Evidence to this effect are the fact that he is your only candidate for the Global Products position that someone from Houston has to be part of the World Tour in Europe Brent Price that your candidates for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David Port or Richard Sage and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve Young Further for the record I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry has a credibility issueArthur Andersen other Global Products personnell and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to meI just happen to be the most vocal Ted Fernley DysonPM ToRichard Causey Corp Enron ENRON ccRick Buy HOU ECT ECT John Sherriff LON ECT ECT Ted Murphy HOU ECT ECT Sally Beck HOU ECT ECT SubjectTrading Support OperationsLondon Rick Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support function particularly as it relates to our Global Products business we already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more permanent solution Wellnothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry understands this as well as anybody If we had a more suitable candidate we would give him her the job I have seen Barry develop and mature over the lastmonths along with the team that we have built around him I m convinced that he can add significant value by drawing the Global Products support functions in to the fold However he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and whilst I do not share Ted s views I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded I suggest that we continue to search for a candidateknown and trusted within Houston who can instill confidence there Steve Young head of RAC in London may be an interesting option although I m sure he would not be easy to replace In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will be monitoring the situation very closely Regards Fernley
