 louise the overall idea seems logical as a method to leverage collateral received on profitable deals one additional benefit would be if this allowed us to use other securities as collateral that a counterparty would not accept i m not sure what kind of other securities we have i also think that for enrononline to continue it s success that in the medium term it will need some form of margining collateral as part of the system but you will have a better sense for weither this would be an issue in the us given a healthy enronit is an issue in europe and with banks regardless issuesbig systems issue for implementing a same day mark to market and liquidity calculation accross all products on enrononline therefore i assume this would be rolled out only on the highest volume products this will increase the cost of each transaction liquidity algorithm will be hard for counterparties to swallow as they will not want to post incremental capital contract issuedo you make the collateral part of all enrononline deals as if you don t it will be difficult to differentiate between counterparties existing exposureshow do we assign the collateral rights on existing net exposures to vmac this will likely be a logistical issue as you must have many counterparties but if the high value ones are few it could be doable but why would the counterparty agree as he should already have our collateral e g lc or this may require him posting more timingthis might be implemented by end of q but is unlikely to give you immediate benefit costam not sure what us brokerage is but this seems to be equivalent toof brokerage as it is being paid on both sides does this destroy margins thresholdwould there be a credit threshold as if not this would be very onnerous on all parties quick wineffectively you are using collateral received to post collateral through a sleave would it not be possible to negotiate this directly with a counterparty given a select few who require high postings currently in either case you would have to negotiate adjustment to collateral but if it can be done without a sleave but with a bigger haircut then you would avoid the delay in setting this up wholesale i do not know if this is legally possible i ll call to discuss and if you want me to do more detailed work let me know m original message fromkitchen louise sent novembertoromano marcello subjectfwvmac transaction i ll get you working original message fromeichmann marc sentwednesday november pm tokitchen louise; lavorato john ccrichter brad subjectvmac transaction louise and johnhere is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with vmac virtual markets assurance corporation fsa financial securities assurance fsa is an aaa rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal here are the deal highlightsfsa would wrap enron s credit exposure as follows in case of default fsa would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactionsin case enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to vmac fsa would pay the counterparties with thecollateral previously posted by enron and managed on a day to day basis fsa has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to enron based on its net collateral position billion as of today and the net mark to market position billion to date haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant fsavmac would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions under the current structure the only risk fsa vmac is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts please find enclosed the following transaction structure describes the payment logic in case of defaultterms and conditions describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contractcollateral haircuts describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to fsa to guarantee our net mark to market position if out of the moneyfsa snapshotfsa ratingaaa qualification of fsa by moody s please feel free to contact me or brad richter to clarify any doubts with respect to this marc eichmann work cell manager transaction development enrononline llc filevmac transaction structure doc filevmac term and conditions doc filecollateral haircuts doc filefsa snapshot doc filefsa rating pdf
