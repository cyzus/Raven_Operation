 louise i only spent an hour on this however i would pass this would keep a lot of orig tech finance people employed for a while in order to manage it and then work off the pieces this looks like a fairly impressive private asset companythey appear to be good developers acquirers etc they even say that they that restructuredof their ppa spresumably they restructured the ones that make sensefurther reduces our restructuring proposition to me the qf optionality goes like this if you have a highvariable cost qf that operates as a baseload facility the math works to shut it down or convert to a peaking ppa when the market is lowif the market is high you have an easytodevelop expansion problem is their assets appear to have low variable costs coal and new gas so the restructuring play does not jump out at me and we are bearish on development at pv this could look like a good diversified low risk businesssuperior to most of our regulated businesses and most of our international businesses but i think it would be real tough to get returns besides i think someone will pay more for it over half the net mw is new fa capacityattractive to calpine and the calpine wanabees this is actually a cheap way for an ipp to hit its mw growth targets without blowing their brains out in the spot market someone should pay upnot us questiondid we form qf teams in the east and west because of the success of east coast powerwas that success largely driven by the fact that we bought it cheapor did we innovatively restructure the ppaif we brought innovative financing to the deal isn t that the same as buying it cheapwas east coast power a formal auction or was it a negotiated deali can dig into this some more if you d like our internal model would be my next step let me know regards chris calger
