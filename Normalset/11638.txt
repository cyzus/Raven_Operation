 preschedule had a heckuva day on friday due to many problems some of our tags were not completed until after the pm preschedule deadline apparently some of our counterparties automatically deny late tags though they may be corrections of tags made prior to the deadline in any case we have a list of tags that have been submitted as realtime tags and the schedules should be treated such the tags and paths are as followsdelayed tag needs submitted no later than an hour before schedule flows mw he onpsco g wsyspsco t wsys craig gfdeserret t craig bonanzamnfdeserret t bonanza mona mnfpac t mona redbutte fnevp t redbutte mead mnfpscoepmiaps t mead pv empiaps t mead ww pvfepmipaceciso t pv malinpace t mal pace syspace delayed tag needs submitted no later than an hour before schedule flows mw he inpsco g wsyspsco t wsys craig gfdeseret t craig bonanzamnfdeseret t bonanza mona mnfpac t mona redbutte fnevp t redbutte mead mnfpscoepmiaps t mead ww pvfepmisrpsrp t pv kyrene gfsrp delayed tag needs submitted no later than an hour before schedule flows mw he inpsco g wsyspsco t wsys craig gfdeseret t craig bonanzamnfdeseret t bonanza mona mnfpac t mona redbutte fnevp t redbutte mead mnfpscoepmiaps t mead ww pvfepmipnmepe t pv wwsrp t ww meadnevp mead mw he ondgt mona aeppscoepmipac t mona redbuttenevp t redbutte meadnevp mw he ondgt mona aeppscoepmipac t mona redbuttenevp t redbutte meadcrc mead mw he ondgt mona aeppscoepmipac t mona redbuttenevp t redbutte meadcrc mead delayed tag needs submitted no later than an hour before schedule flows mw he onpsco g wsyspsco t wsys craig gfdeserret t craig bonanzamnfdeserret t bonanza mona mnfpac t mona redbutte fnevp t redbutte mead mnfpscoepmiaps t mead pv empiaps t mead ww pvfepmipaceciso t pv malinpace t mal pace syspace thanks donald ps lisa will be adding to this list with a following note
