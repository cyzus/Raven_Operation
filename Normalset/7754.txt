 following the discussions i have had with louise and jay this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in newcofor the first few weeks to a few months we continue to use infinity to update the curves atpm i will need to have one trader to execute mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange cd etc louise i hope you have this in your budget and headcount i will need one junior trader and maybe two as things grow to help do this job i have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk if this goes forwardin the first few weeks jay webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do with significantly lower costs we also will redesign the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books to make it simpler and easier to ensure there is no more discussion ever of driftreallocation i propose a method where every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter less any transaction expenses i would expect that the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly as we start making money hope this answers the questions we will have the curves at the right time done by the trading group we will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies we intend to allocate small var to that risk management we would deal primarily with one or two counterpartiesthe parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk just to be very clear while i am happy to manage this risk with extra help i am primarily interested in the running of power options and structured products harry psi cant find jeffrey gossett in the email system stacey can you forward the email to him i dont know if he is an ene employee original message fromkitchen louise sentmonday january pm togossett jeffrey c ; arora harry; webb jay cclavorato john subjectreinterest rates harry jay can you help come to some conclusion on this original message fromgossett jeffrey c sentmonday january pm tolavorato john; kitchen louise subjectinterest rates john louisegiven that under the current plan the bank will be trading our interest rate risk i doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to newco in order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve should i plan on just getting access to reuters and setting a curve off of libor on my ownjeff
