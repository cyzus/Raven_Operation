 mike scott eric after brainstorming and discussing further on data here we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as followswe need bankrupt default and nondefault which covers nonbankrupt accounts withquarterly observation snapshots andmonths performance following the latest snapshot monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entiremonths performance period we will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights for the purpose of model validation we will need data with above specs coveringmonths of performance this means that we will need rollingquarterly snapshotsmonths performance data formonthly shiftsinput snapshots performancemarch endjune endseptember enddecember endmonth end performance for janthrough dec feb endmay endaugust endnovember endmonth end performance for decthrough nov jan endapr endjuly endoctober endmonth end performance for novthrough oct december endmar endjune endseptember endmonth end performance for octthrough sepwe will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator if available during the performance period our definition of default is either bankruptcy ordays delinquency on any trade credit we have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big picture it makes sense to spend the extra amount to get the right data for analysis please let me know your thoughts this will require d b to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly regards amitava
