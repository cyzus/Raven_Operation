 mark after recently reviewing the booking of the p options it is myunderstanding that these options are being valued using a standard spreadoption model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread areassumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes i e the priceprocess assumptions are consistent with standard black model assumptionsextended to two commodities the payoff for a call option ispayoffd maxa b k wheread nxwti delivery price for nymex bd posting priced wti swap posting basis k d posting bonus fixed the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread optionsis that leg b of the spread is a combination of three prices the twofutures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month and theaverage posting basis during the delivery month combination of theseprices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg b andthe correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket ofprices and its correlation with the nxwti price i believe that thisapproach is more straightforward than the alternative which would be to usea three or fourcommodity model with its associated volatility andcorrelation matrices in summary i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation ofthese types of options assuming that the inputs are set correctly regards stinson gibner v p research
