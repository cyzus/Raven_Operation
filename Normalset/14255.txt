 michelle i agree with you that we need to run at leastiterations but i did not realize that it tookhours to runiterations helen and i talked earlier about using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts and run the parts separately on different processors then aggregate the results this procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time looks like we have to do it this way now buying a more powerful computer helps but does not solve the problem in addition we might want to reconsider if writing the code in vb is optimal i was assured at the very beginning that vb runs as fast if not faster as c but some reassurance from it group on this issue is helpful best alex frommichelle d cisneros ectpm toalex huang corp enron enron ccgary hickerson danielle romain subjectgeneration earnings model hi alex danielle and i were talking to david m today regarding running the model for purposes of back testing the results last week we ran calpine usingdays of historical forward price data atanditerations theiteration run tookhours to run to run allcompanies with thedays worth of data and atiterations is estimated to take aboutdays we are concerned thatiterations will not be sufficient and will need to be increased to at leastiterations we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful than the test computer we have been using do you have any suggestions as to how we can improve the processthanks michelle x hi alex danielle and i were talking to david m today regarding running the model for purposes of back testing the results last week we ran calpine usingdays of historical forward price data atanditerations theiteration run tookhours to run to run allcompanies with thedays worth of data and atiterations is estimated to take aboutdays we are concerned thatiterations will not be sufficient and will need to be increased to at leastiterations we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful than the test computer we have been using do you have any suggestions as to how we can improve the processthanks michelle x
