davis energy speech the associated press pdt here is the text of gov gray davis televised speech on energy thursday as prepared for deliverygood evening i m speaking to you tonight from sacramento on the most difficult issue facing californiaour energy crisis simply stated we have two problemssupply is too low and costs are too high both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created inbut no matter how we got into this mess you hired me to solve problems and that s what i m doing the only longterm solution is to build more power plants we must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities but prices won t fall and supply won t be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume yet in theyears before i took office not a single major power plant was built in california not one since i became governor we ve licensedmajor power plants ten more are in the pipeline and we re doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies the generators are free to charge whatever they want because they re governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices this past winter the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy in january with the feds still refusing to do their job california stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy we didn t take over to save the utilities we took over to keep the power on and the economy strong that s not all we also negotiated longterm contracts for electricity at vastly lower pricesi used my emergency powers to seize control of lowcost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generatorswe began negotiations to buy the utilities transmission systemwe cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plantswe re launching anmillion conservation programwe re moving to establish a public power authority to build more power if the private sector fails to build all the plants california needs we ll build them ourselvesand because i share your concern that the generators are ripping us off we re using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct we can t fixyears of inaction overnight but we re making real progress now as you know i have fought tooth and nail against raising rates it s become increasingly clear however that with rising natural gas prices the feds failure to control costs and the state s lack of supply that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong but i remain committed to protecting average californians from massive rate hikes so i m urging the public utilities commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back under my proposal more than half of you won t pay a penny more for the rest the average increase will bepercent for many of that group rates will rise only aboutpercent the heaviest users will see their rates risepercent on average that includes business paying their share this is in addition to thepercent surcharge we ve all been paying since last winter but all californians can reduce their bills through conservation here s the pointthe more you use the more you pay the more you conserve the more you save conservation is our best shortterm weapon against blackouts and pricegouging by flexing your power you ll help secure our energy future unlike the puc my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financial stabilityif they agree to three main conditionsthey must provide lowcost regulated power to the state foryears agree to sell us their transmission system and dismiss their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates my proposal raises rates fairly assures us of longterm power stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation our emphasis on conservation is critical in order to make it through the summer we must cut demand by at leastpercent already we ve launched programs to cut back commercial lighting and reduce consumption in office buildings schools and government facilities friends we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless we aremillion strong and if each of us does our part we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer we are californians we ve withstood earthquakes floods fires and droughts yes this mess is manmade but with your help and god s blessing we ll get through this as well thank you and good nightcopyrightap
